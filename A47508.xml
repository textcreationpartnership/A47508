            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is uſual for moſt Readers, ſo ſoon as they have read over the Title of a Book, (and that but by halves too) to skip over the Epistle and Preface (if there be any) and immediately jump into the matter: ſo that I doubt <hi>I</hi> ſhall be ſo ſerved and loſe my deſign in writeing one, and then I will aſſure the Reader, he will not receive that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now <hi>I</hi> have beſpoke you to read the Preface, if you are gone thus far, I queſtion not but you will proceed: and ſo will <hi>I,</hi> leſt <hi>I</hi> be counted impertinently tedious.</p>

None can deſcribe a ſtorm ſo well as thoſe that have bin in one, and thoſe men that uſe the Sea all their life time, and met with all the uncertain caſualties that watry E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement produces, and many Enemies abroad too: yet they have the good luck ſo to come off, as to gain large Eſtates, and in their old Age dye at home in peace, and be carryed to their graves with all their limbs and bones, in as much perfection as they were born.

give you a general account, but that you may the better underſtand it, I muſt acquaint you with ſome of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding actions.

            <p>This was the <hi>misfortune</hi> of the year <hi>1666,</hi> and the times proving hard, and my Rents coming in very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; my Debts worſe, it was <hi>1669</hi> ere I had with much trouble and difficulty paid all theſe Debts: but then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretty clear, and having a stock worth <hi>2</hi> or <hi>300 l.</hi> to begin to trade with, and being above all things deſirous to live in a new houſe in <hi>London:</hi> I endeavoured to get in moneys that were oweing me, among other Debts I had <hi>400 l.</hi> due in one place, which although it was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in future, yet at preſent I could not get a penny: I laboured all I could, and a Gentleman that was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what concerned in it, did after my much importunity, promiſe to pay me <hi>200 l.</hi> of the money at preſent, and the rest afterwards. I took his promiſe for currant payment, (and thereupon engaged to take a houſe) but it did not prove ſo: and after long attendance I loſt the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of that houſe, and took one of him that had ſo long promiſed me the money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>: did believe it to be in a place fit for my purpoſe, in general, and expected great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment from my new Landlord in particular; I was to give <hi>40 l.</hi> fine and <hi>40 l</hi> per annum, and indeed I did not pay, but receive money for he paid me <hi>60</hi> pound in money, the <hi>40 l.</hi> fine made <hi>100 l.</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>200 l.</hi> ſo long promiſed me was to run out of the rent: this was our agreement, I ſetled my ſelf accordingly; when I firſt came thither, all the Neighbouring houſes were tenanted, and as I thought well too, but in few monthes it proved otherwiſe: for moſt of them were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and gone within the year, and I left almoſt alone; I in hopes of a trade, had disburſed all the ready mony <hi>I</hi> could make, and had run my ſelf <hi>100</hi> pound in debt, and all to inlarge my ſtock: but for all that it came to that paſs at laſt, that <hi>I</hi> could not take money enough in

my ſhop to maintain my Family, and ſome old and now Creditors beginning to come upon me, <hi>I</hi> knew not which way to turn me, this diſtracted me in my mind, neither was my body free: for finding there was little good to be done at home in my ſhop, &amp; <hi>I</hi> went to try what <hi>I</hi> could do abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and walked about the ſtreets in the dirt, ſo long that <hi>I</hi> got ſo violent a cold that <hi>I</hi> could not ſpeak, and this being neglected and ſlighted, hath continued with me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince, and doubt will to my grave, whether <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe it will bring me ſooner then <hi>I</hi> expected.

                  <p>The Author gives his Reaſon for the Title, <hi>Unlucky Citizen,</hi> and his intended manner of Writing. He treats of <hi>Lucky,</hi> and <hi>unlucky</hi> Perſons in general; and reflecting on his own particular Misfortunes, reſolves to give an Account of them.</p>

               <p>BEfore I begin my intended Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it will not be amiſs to ſay ſomewhat about the Title of it, and why I call it the <hi>Unlucky Citizen.</hi> Truly, my Reaſon (in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) is very good; and in ſhort, thus:</p>

Treatiſe, to conſiſt in a plain Recital of my Misfortunes, which I may very well tearm <hi>Unlucky;</hi> and I apply them to the Word <hi>Citizen,</hi> becauſe ſuch an one I am, being ſo born and bred; And as he is reckoned to be a <hi>right Gentleman,</hi> that is ſo by three Diſcents, ſo I by that Rule may reckon my ſelf to be a <hi>right Citizen;</hi> and moſt, if not all the Misfortunes that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me, were in or near the <hi>City,</hi> within the Sound of <hi>Bow Bell:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scene lying there, and my Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity being ſuch, I may not unfitly tearm it <hi>Citizen.</hi> And now having in few words ſatisfied you in my Reaſon of the Title, I ſhall fall upon the matter in Hand, but I muſt tell you, that you muſt nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any laborious Piece, or rhetorical Expreſſions; you ſhall not find my <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, Greek,</hi> here; nor hard <hi>cramping Words,</hi> ſuch as will ſtop you in the middle of your Story to conſider what is meant by them; you may read all that is here written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of a <hi>Dictionary;</hi> you ſhall need none, no not ſo much as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> one; and the Truth is, if I had a mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found you with hard Tearms; I'le aſſure you I cannot, having not been bred ſo

good a Scholar: Here you ſhall onely read a plain Story, ſuch as you would have told; for I intend to write as freely and as naturally as I would tell a Tale to you; and ſuch kind of Language I think to be the fitteſt for this Diſcourſe, which thus I ſhall begin.</p>
               <p>Not long ſince it was my <hi>Fortune</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or ill I know not) to drink a Glaſs of Wine with an old Acquaintance; (I know not yet whether I may tearm him <hi>Friend</hi>) and he having lately fallen into a very deep Misfortune, from which he was not then diſengaged, was therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of his hard Fortune. I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him thus complain for one <hi>bad Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> (for to my knowledge he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much inbettered his Condition in the Main,) and knowing my ſelf to be much more <hi>unfortunate</hi> than he, (for I preſently told him of many Loſſes and Croſſes had happened unto me ſince I laſt ſaw him.) I therefore made ſlight of his preſent Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap; and he and I diſcourſing upon that Subject, he recited to me theſe two Lines:
<q>
                     <l>The lucky have their Days, and thoſe they chuſe,</l>
                     <l>The unlucky have but hours, &amp; thoſe they looſe</l>
                  </q>
I was very much taken with the Sence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107141:14"/>
of theſe two Lines, and the conſideration of the truth thereof, at that time did much affect me, ſo that we did agen enlarge upon that Subject, and by many Examples did make out, that as the old Wife ſays, <hi>Give a man Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k and throw him into the Sea:</hi> The <hi>lucky</hi> man does as he pleaſes, he <hi>hath the World in a ſtring,</hi> he can be rich when he will, and though he hath bin a <hi>Spendthrift</hi> and a <hi>Prodigal;</hi> nay although he hath broke twice or thrice, yet when he <hi>takes up,</hi> if he hath a mind to an Eſtate, it is but wiſhing for it and he hath it, and many Examples we had to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; When as on the other ſide, to the <hi>Unlucky</hi> every thing goes croſs and retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, let him riſe early, and lye down late, pinch his belly and ſpare from his back, and in all things play the good Husband, yet he is never the better. This diſcourſe took up ſome time, and ſo we parted; but although I left his company, yet I carried the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recited two Lines with me, which made a very great impreſſion on my mind, and my Spirit hath bin troubled about them; for conſidering with my ſelf, the Misfortunes that have befaln me, I concluded that I was one of theſe <hi>Unlucky</hi> perſons, who having but <hi>Hours</hi> of good Fortune had loſt them. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107141:14"/>
then, falling into conſideration of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I could not find many, if any good hours that had happened, and ſtill being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, I conſidered of this Subject, and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that if I ſhould collect the Misfortunes and Troubles that I had waded through, and the little good Luck I had, it would be very admirable, and I might then conclude my ſelf one of theſe <hi>Unlucky Ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Werefore I looked back, and revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in my mind, and having ſum'd up all thoſe conſiderable Actions that I had done, ever ſince I could remember, I found them to be very numerous and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and might, if well digeſted and ordered, be of good uſe; I then had a fancy of printing them, but upon ſecond thoughts I found it might redound to my diſadvantage, eſpecially if it ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, becauſe I ſhould diſcover many Secrets which were not convenient to be known to the World. To avoid which Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, I propounded ſeveral wayes to my ſelf: Firſt, as to change the Scene of the Place, and to alter my true Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſo diſguiſe things, that thereby I might be rendered unknown, but that appeared to be ſuch an endleſs piece
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107141:15"/>
of Work, and withall ſo difficult, that I declined that Courſe, and was reſolved to be plain and ſincere; eſpecially when ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a View of my Actions, I could not find my ſelf guilty of any thing I ought to be aſhamed of; but then again, having occaſion to recite the unjuſt and hard Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings which I have found from ſome; and reckoning of them up and muſtering them together, I found that I had not onely out lived the moſt part of all my Friends, but alſo my Enemies: And as for thoſe few that were yet in being, doubting that they might alleadge, that I was ſatyrical and libelled againſt them; I ſought a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for that, and thus reſolved that I would name no Perſons nor Places, and therefore it would not be generally known who was meane; but if they who were really intended, did read, and out of a ſenſe of their Guilt found themſelves touched, they might make good uſe and amend.</p>
               <p>Having thus to my ſelf cleared theſe, and ſeveral other Scruples that aroſe, I did reſolve to write, and that the Truth, naked as ſhe was; and having already been in Print, in writing ſomewhat of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107141:15"/>
I was the leſs concerned at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vogue of the people; neither did I much value it, ſo as I might gain by them, and that ſo conſiderable, that I might have occaſion to unſay what I now write, and tearm my ſelf the <hi>Lucky Citizen:</hi> In hopes whereof, and for the other Reaſons aforeſaid, I once again put Pen to Paper; and ſhall give you a Taſte or brief Account of my Misfortunes, whereby it will be no hard matter to make good Proof of the Truth of this Title, <hi>The Unlucky Citizen.</hi>

               <p>BEfore I ſhall begin the Relation of my own Misfortunes, I ſhall not (as it is uſual in Books of this nature, viz. <hi>Guſman Lazarillo de Tormes,</hi> or our late <hi>Engliſh Rogue</hi>) give you any Account of the Miſcarriages of my Parents, becauſe, for ought I know they were without any (except thoſe of humane frailty) for my Father was, though not born in the City, born a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107141:16"/>
Father being one before him, and by right he was admitted a Freeman, as I was alſo after him. My Mother was born of honeſt and wealthy Parents, whoſe Predeceſſors had ſeveral other Children, and I can reckon that from them have proceeded above two hundred ſouls, a third part of which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and in proſperous Condition: ſome of them arriv'd to Eminency in Church and State, and ſo their Succeſſors continue.</p>
               <p>Such were my Parents who bred me up in my youth, with care and tenderneſs. I was deſign'd to be a <hi>Church-man</hi> in Quality as well as Name; for one of my Mothers Brothers being an eminent Perſon in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> intended to educate me as a Scholar, but his Death put an end to that Deſign; ſo I reckon his death the firſt of my <hi>Misfortunes:</hi> However, I was kept at School, and inſtructed in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, but by a rigid Maſter, and receiving ſlender encouragement from a ſparing Father, I profited little therein; but yet in time I was able to make half a dozen <hi>Latine</hi> Verſes, which he ſhew'd to my Father, telling him he muſt encourage me with money, but he being loath to part with that, gave me little, and being ask'd, he replied, a half penny;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107141:17"/>
which cauſed my Maſter to laugh then at me, ſince when he hath told me the Story<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying, he could not expect me to be very much in love with the <hi>Muſes</hi> when I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo ſmall Encouragement. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Reader, I tell thee, thou art to expect little Poetry in this Diſcourſe, ſince I had ſo ſmall a Reward for my firſt Eſſay therein.</p>
               <p>Thus was I bred till it was time to be an Apprentice, and in all that time I do not remember that I was Maſter of any money onely once I happened upon a Six Pence, and having lately read that famous Book, of the <hi>Fryar and the Boy,</hi> and being hugely pleaſed with that, as alſo the excellent Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Seven wiſe Maſters of Room,</hi> and having heard great Commendation of <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> I laid out all my mony for that, and thougth I had a great bargain, conceiting that the Lady <hi>Fortune</hi> would one time or other beſtow ſuch a Purſe upon me as ſhe did on <hi>Fortunatus;</hi> now having read this Book, and being deſirous of reading more of that nature; one of my School-fellows lent me <hi>Docter Fauſtus,</hi> which alſo pleaſed me, eſpecially when he travelled in the Air, ſaw all the World, and did what he, liſted; but I was as much troubled when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107141:17"/>
the <hi>Devil</hi> came to fetch him; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that horrible end did ſo much terrifie me, that I often dreamed of it. The next Book I met with was <hi>Fryar Bacon,</hi> whoſe pleaſant Stories much delighted me: But when I came to Knight Errantry, and reading <hi>Montelion Knight of the Oracle,</hi> and <hi>Ornatus</hi> and <hi>Arteſia,</hi> and the Famous <hi>Pariſmus;</hi> I was contentented beyond meaſure, and (believing all I read to be true) wiſhed my ſelf Squire to one of theſe Knights: I proceeded on to <hi>Palmer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All the time I had from School, as <hi>Thurſdays</hi> in the Afternoon, and <hi>Saturdays,</hi> I ſpent in reading theſe Books; ſo that I being who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected to them, and reading how that <hi>Amadis</hi> and other Knights not knowing their Parents, did in time prove to be Sons of Kings and great Perſonages; I had ſuch a fond and idle Opinion, that I might in time prove to be ſome great Perſon, or

at leaſtwiſe be Squire to ſome Knight: And therefore I being asked, What Trade I would be of? firſt ſcorned to be any, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that I was not born to ſo mean a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but upon ſecond thoughts, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be a Chirurgion, and that for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſons; as firſt, becauſe I often found them mentioned in Books of Knight Errantry; and ſecondly, that I might tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and thereby ſee all theſe ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of <hi>Conſtantinople, Trebizond,</hi> and I know not what Places; and then I did judge that if I were a Chirurgion and did travel, and meet with Knights Errant who were wounded; I ſhould be very neceſſary and uſeful in dreſſing and healing their Wounds, therefore a Chirurgeon I was reſolved to be, and the onely Reaſon why I would be ſo, was that I might travel; which my Mother underſtanding, and not being willing to venture me abroad, would not permit me to be of that Trade, wherefore I was to think again, and then I could not think upon any Trade that would pleaſe me ſo well as a Bookſeller, becauſe, by that means I might read all ſorts of hiſtory Books, and thereby pleaſe my ſelf with reading, but I was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken therein, for as the Proverb ſays, <hi>Who
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107141:18"/>
goes worſe Shoo'd than the Shoo-makers Wife?</hi> So I, ſince I dealt in Bookſelling, have read fewer Books than formerly: but my Father would not allow of this Trade, becauſe he who had never made uſe of any Book, but the <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> and knew no more but ſome School Books, did ſuppoſe it to be an unprofitable Trade, and profit it was he aimed at. I took my pleaſure, delighting in nothing but thoſe ſorts of Books, ſo that I wonder I did not become another <hi>Don Quixot.</hi> It was fear and want of years that hindered me from ſearching the fields for Knights, I had a great deſire to ſee one, ſuppoſing him to be more than a man, ſoon after having a ſight of one, he being only in Doublet and Breeches, with a Sword by his ſide, I could not believe him to be a Knight, for I expected him to be armed <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a-pee,</hi> with a Lance in his hand, and mounted on a prancing Courſer, for ſuch I had read of, and ſeen at the Tower among the Arms. I believ'd, though we had not many Knights in <hi>England,</hi> yet they were plentiful in other Countreys; and as Hiſtories were moſt in other Languages, ſo there were moſt in <hi>France.</hi> I having read five parts of <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> procuring a Dictionary, began
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107141:19"/>
to hammer out the Sence of ſome part of it; and finally, I took ſo much pains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that I attained to an indifferent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that Language, and getting ſome odd Books that were <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I made my ſelf a kind of Dictionary from them (I being forc'd to reſtore the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one) ſo that with a little pains taking, I could pretty well underſtand a <hi>French</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; eſpecially if it treated of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, of which ſort of Books I was ſo great a Lover, and had ſo firm a belief of the truth of them, that I reckoned them to be Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, and believed them before <hi>Stow, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſhed,</hi> or <hi>Speed;</hi> and becauſe upon ſearch I could not find <hi>Palmerin of England,</hi> nor no other of our <hi>Engliſh Knights Errant,</hi> I wholly ſlighted them as erroneous; and ſo great a mind I had to be a Knight, or at leaſt a Squire, that it puts me in mind of a fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or rather fanatical conceited Opinion, of one of my Acquaintance. But before I tell you the Story, it will not be impertinent to give you an Account of the Perſon.</p>
               <p>He had been a Book-binder, which Trade had, as he ſaid, kept him very poor, ſo that he was forced oftentimes to pawn his Cloak to buy Leather, and when his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107141:19"/>
Work was done, and he carried it home on a <hi>Saturday</hi> night, expecting money to buy his <hi>Sundays</hi> Dinner, he went often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and was put to many hard Shifts, ſo that he ſtudied out ſome other ways to get Money: At length, it being in the late time of Rebellion, and Liberty, and he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Preaching Trade was in moſt Vogue, and moſt profitable, he ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died ſome Points of Divinity; or rather, fantaſtical Inventions of his own; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus furniſhed, away he goes to one of the <hi>Conventicle</hi> Meetings, where he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the preſent Preacher, or <hi>Prater</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and broaching ſome <hi>new Notions,</hi> he was generally well approved of by all, but cryed up chiefly by his Female Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: And now having made ſo good a beginning he was reſolved to proceed, and being ſufficiently endued with convenient boldneſs, and as confidently ignorant as the beſt of them, he became a <hi>Preacher,</hi> and maintaining his <hi>new Notions,</hi> he was ſo cryed up for a <hi>New Light,</hi> that their old Preacher was ſlighted, and he admitted in his place: His chiefeſt ends being to get Money, he took the courſe to do it by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in with his <hi>Female Auditors,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107141:20"/>
of their Husbands Goods to him, and he <hi>held forth</hi> to them in the beſt manner he could; but he being but poor, and by this means wholly leaving his Work, for all the Forenoon he lay in bed to ſtudy how to prate in the Afternoon; this took up all his time, and he began to want, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Good Wives would frequently feaſt him with the <hi>Good Creature,</hi> yet little money came from them, ſo that he was weary of his new Employ, and reſolved to quit it; but before he left them, he put one Trick upon them, for pretending that he was arreſted for Twenty Pounds, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than let him be carried to Priſon, the Congregation raiſed ſo much money for him; but when he was Maſter of ſo tall a Sum, he left them and that Quality: in which, as he told me, he had ſtill continued, had he found a ſufficient Maintainance, but that failing, he quitted the other; and from that was reſolved on another Courſe, and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> having failed him, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to try what the <hi>Law</hi> would do; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he profeſſing Knowledge therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Solicitor,</hi> and that he might be thought a man of great Buſineſs and Practice, he would appoint his Clyents to come to him
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107141:20"/>
in a Morning, and lying in Bed till Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Clock, he would pretend Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Buſineſs, and then riſing he would come out with his Papers in his Hands, and pretend ſo great haſte, that he would not ſtay, unleſs it were to take their Money; and then telling them their Buſineſs ſhould be diſpatch'd, away he would haſten to <hi>Guild Hall,</hi> to the Sheriffs Court, there he pretended to do buſineſs, when as he underſtood it no more than the <hi>Sheriffs Horſe,</hi> as he has often told me; but this his Practice did not do his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his time to thrive was not yet come, or this was not the way that he was to take; but ſoon after he fell into it, and thriv'd ſufficiently; for having a ſmall Stock of Moneys, he did ſo turn it, and wind it by buying of Bargains, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had but little Skill, yet he often doubled his Money; and his <hi>lucky Days</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, he made his own Choice; for although he ſtill lay in Bed till Noon, and then onely eating, went to the Alehouſe or Tavern, doing nothing, nor taking no Care, yet whenever he had a mind to it (he ſtill keeping ready Money by him) would go and buy a Bargain that ſhould be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107141:21"/>
conſiderably profitable ſo that in ſhort time he that was not worth a hundred Pence, could boaſt of ſeveral hundred Pounds of his own, and in his Quality and Condition I knew him when he would ſometimes reflect and look back upon his former life, and tell me the former ſtories; but amongſt all the ſtories of his life, his ſtrange opinions were the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for he would pretend to know every thing; he could reſolve thoſe Queſtions that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was ignorant in, and he from a preciſe <hi>Preacher</hi> became a groſs <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> alleadging that <hi>all things came by chance,</hi> and that there was no beginning, nor would there be no ending of the World nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it: Saying, that the wiſe man ſaid, <hi>there was nothing new under the Sun;</hi> and that as Corn when it dies and rots in the ground ſo it ſprings agen, lives, and is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: And ſo, ſaid he, is man, for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies, onely being buried and laid in the earth for a time, he lives again, and is by his ſecond life more pure than he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and thereupon it is, that we have thoſe Improvements in Arts and Sciences; I laugh'd at his Conceits, and asked him if he were ever alive before? he replied,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107141:21"/>
yes, he beheved he had bin, but that it was ſo long ſince that he could not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it. He ſeriouſly diſcourſing after this manner, and I laughing at him, but for all that he would go on, and aver that this was ſound Philoſophy: I replied that however it was not ſound Divinity; to this he anſwered, that Divinity was not to be concerned in a Philoſophical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; for that the one was grounded on Faith, the other on Reaſon. But I ſhall proceed no further in this Diſcourſe, for he made no great progreſs in it, for in ſhort time after he died to experiment his fanatical Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>And now I have done with him, I ſhall tell you the occaſion of bringing him in here: It was for his Opinion's ſake, for e're ſince he urged it to me, I have bin thinking with my ſelf whether I was ever alive in this World before this time, for if I was, I cannot remember it, ſure it was a great while ago if ever, ſure it was when Gyants lived here, and <hi>Knight Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> was publickly profeſſed, when <hi>Amadis</hi> was King of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Liſvart</hi> King of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> as the ſtory relates; and then <hi>as ſure as Death,</hi> I was either a Knight or Squire
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107141:22"/>
at the leaſt, ſo great an affection have I always had for <hi>Knight Errantry.</hi> I can not abſolutely affirm that I was a Knight, (although I very much honour and love that Quality for the fair Ladies ſakes,) for I am not at preſent Maſter of ſo much Valour as many of thoſe Knights I have read of, eſpecially <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> who in my opinion was the moſt valiant, moſt adventurous, and greateſt <hi>Kill-Cow</hi> of them all; for he made nothing of killing Knights by hundreds, and Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants by dozens; ſome with Blows down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, cleaving them in twain, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others off in the middle, although he himſelf hath been foundly bang'd, which Sport I never liked by any means; but however, I wiſhed him well, and have done more for him than any body elſe; for I have finiſhed his Story in a Second and Third Parts; and therefore he is more beholden to me than to <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> who although he had a mind to it, yet he never did it. If I was alive, in former Ages, and was that very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> it may well be, for elſe how ſhould I be ſo well acquainted with his Story; but I am rather encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to believe that as ſome Cunning-man,

                  <p>The variety of good and bad Fortune that did befall one who was reported to be <hi>Atheiſtical,</hi> and his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections thereupon.

               </argument>
               <p>THe Goodwife's Proverb is, that <hi>one Shoulder of Mutton drives down another,</hi> ſo one ſtory of an Atheiſt puts me in mind of another ſuppoſed one, ſo that before I proceed to my ſubject, I pray give me leave to enlarge a little further. 'Twas reported of a rich Citizen that is reputed to be <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical,</hi> that he ſaid, <hi>ſo long as he went to Church and ſerv'd God, he could not thrive.</hi> I knew the time his Eſtate was far ſhort of what its now yet he hath bin far richer than now, he has had ſeveral turns of <hi>Fortune,</hi> ſomtime being
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107141:24"/>
on the right ſide of <hi>Fortunes</hi> Wheel, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up with the Motto <hi>Regnabo,</hi> I will reign; ſoon after on the Top, with the <hi>Regno,</hi> I do reign; by and by, tumbled to the left ſide, with the Motto <hi>Regnavi,</hi> I have reigned; and then again, quite caſt down to the Bottom, with the Motto <hi>Sum ſine Regno,</hi> I am without Kingdom or Government. In ſhort, I firſt knew this man in a thriving Condition, many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures at Sea, and as many Purchaſes on ſhore, ſo that he might properly enough ſay <hi>Regnabo;</hi> In ſhort time after I knew his Adventures plentifully returned with Succeſs, and his Purchaſes on ſhore, bravely built on, and very well Tenanted, and he wanted nothing that <hi>Fortune</hi> could give him, for as his Eſtate was plentiful, ſo he had plenty of Children of both Sexes, and thoſe very hopeful ones, and he was purchaſing a Coach, and every day expecting to be an Alderman, and ride the great Horſe, ſo that he might proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough ſay <hi>Regno:</hi> Long had he not ſate on the Top of <hi>Fortunes</hi> Wheel, but he was tumbled down to the left-ſide, and that by two great and conſiderable Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the one was by fire, which burnt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107141:24"/>
down moſt of his late flouriſhing Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: And the other was by the Loſs of a Daughter which he had not long before given in Marriage, and with her a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Portion, which by her death was loſt, ſo that I think then he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude on that Motto <hi>Regnavi.</hi> And not long after he received a more ſenſible loſs, for he was quite caſt down to the bottom by the mercileſs fury of that raging Fire, which again burnt all his Tenements, as it did the moſt part of our flouriſhing City, ſo that he was then at the utmoſt bottom of <hi>Fortunes</hi> Wheel, for as the Motto ſays, <hi>Sum ſine Regno,</hi> I am without a Kingdom, ſo was he without Houſes: But God be praiſed, the Wheel is again turning about, his Eſtate is in good Condition, and with the reſt of his Fellow-Citizens built, though not well Tenanted, which is at preſent the chiefeſt Defect of the whole City; and were this man but young again, he might arrive at the <hi>Regno</hi> of <hi>Fortunes</hi> Wheel, but ſuch is the frailty of humane Nature that by ſuch time as a man hath lived long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be wiſe or rich, he dies. It is a great rarity to have any man twice rich, if he is, the Wheel moves apace. I could

                  </gap>ay ſomewhat more of this man, but I ſhall deſiſt, onely concluding this, that as I know not whether he was wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, charged with the former Atheiſtical ſpeech about his thriving; ſo this I know, for I have heard him ſpeak it, that <hi>So many and various have been the Misfortunes of my life, that if I might chooſe, I would not live over my life again to be a Prince at the end of it.</hi> He might in reſpect of his many Misfortunes ſay this reaſonably enough, but if he did conſider that he never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he always had a plentiful Eſtate, and wherewith at the worſt to keep the Wolf from the door: and how many in City and Countrey are at the beſt of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition far below him when at the loweſt, in reſpect of Eſtate; then methinks, this Saying ſeems unreaſonable, to me it does, for I have always comforted my ſelf with the remembrance of this Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Solamen miſeris ſocios habuiſſe dolores.</hi> And with this Conſideration, that let me go where I would, there were ſtill as many if not more, below me in Condition, as there were above me, and that it might be yet much worſe than it was. And now I have done with this Story,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107141:25"/>
which I hope is pertinent enough, ſince it onely treats of the various turns of changeable <hi>Fortune,</hi> and proves that he was ſometimes the <hi>Unlucky Citizen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I will to School agen, where before I leave it, I ſhall tell you ſome of the Misfortunes that happened to me whilſt I was in that condition.</p>
               <p>My Father being very ſparing of his Money to me, ſo that ſometimes I wanted Pens, Ink, Paper, and other Neceſſaries, and I deſtroying a great deal of them in compoſing my new <hi>French</hi> Dictionary, eſpecially Paper; I bethought me of a way how to get ſome, and though my Deſign was good and plauſible, yet I ought not to have taken diſhoneſt or unlawful ways to proſecute it, but I was like the roguiſh Boy that ſtole a Prayer-Book to learn his Prayers by; for I rob'd every Boys Copy-book in the School, by cutting out ſeveral of the middle Leaves of Paper from them, ſo that I ſuppoſing they would not be miſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made bold ſo often, that at length I I was found out, and I very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my Buttocks were torn and cut ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, for tearing the Boys Books, ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107141:26"/>
that I had no mind to purchaſe Paper at ſo dear a Rate again. Whether I may reckon this as a Misfortune I know not, although it was ſo to my Buttocks at preſent, yet I ſuppoſe it was the better for me, for by this means I had no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to filtch any thing for the future. This was a Misfortune in jeſt, but about the ſame time I was like to have had one in earneſt, and that ſuch an one, as would have hindred me from relating, and you from underſtanding any more of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and thus it was,</p>
               <p>My Father being grown wealthy, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving purchaſed ſeveral Tenements in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> was deſirous to have ſome Land in the Countrey, and hearing of a Purchaſe, and agreeing on the Price in part, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to take a journey to the place where it lay, and ſeeing and liking it, to conclude the Bargain. The place being not above twenty miles from <hi>London,</hi> the Seller was to go with him, and I and ſome others were to bear them company; my Father was not ſo ill an Husband as to take Horſes or Coach for us, but there being a Conveniency of going half the way by water, we did ſo, and footed it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107141:26"/>
the reſt of the Journey; we being come within five or ſix miles of the place, and I being ſomewhat tyred, ſtaid at a Friends Houſe, and with me a Young man of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty two years of Age. who had come with us, and my Father proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Journey we walk'd about the Town, till at length coming to a River ſide, at a little diſtance we ſaw ſeveral Boys bathing themſelves therein.</p>
               <p>The Young-man who was with me had a great mind (the weather being hot) to go into the Water, but he did not like the place becauſe it was too publick amongſt ſo many Boys, wherefore we go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther up the River to a place he thought convenient, he ſtript himſelf, and I by his Example did the like, both plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the water, but he, for his part, never came out again, till he was fetch'd out, and that ſtark dead, I remember I was very near bearing him company, for the place where we went in being near a deep Hole or Whirlpit, drew me as it had done him thitherwards, and down I floun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the very bottom, I could ſwim no more than a ſtone, but whether it was with ſtrugling, or as they ſay, the nature
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107141:27"/>
of Drowning-people is to riſe three times, I know not, but riſe agen I did to the top of the Water, but I was inſtantly down agen, my Eyes being open, I could ſee where I was, but I had no time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what to do, onely ſtill continued ſtruggling, whilſt the water continued guggling down into my Belly, it finding paſſage enough through my Noſe and Ears, but chiefly my Mouth, I roſe and ſunk twice, and was come up the third time, when ſtruggling with my Legs and Arms, I accidentally caught hold on a Fiſhing rod which a young Lad held out to me, and ſo was drawn out of the Water. I was no ſooner on the ſhore, (but thanking God for my Deliverance) I was ſhew'd where my Friend lay at the bottom of the water, where it being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhallow, we could ſee him, for the violence of the Stream had forced he and I both into the Whirlpit, and had driven him paſt it, ſo that I ſaw him, and by the help of a Boat that was fetch'd from the Town he was taken up ſtark dead, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was held up by the heels and other remedies uſed, yet all to no purpoſe. Thus did he periſh and I eſcape, yet I was very near a <hi>Misfortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:107141:27"/>My Father ſoon returning from his Journey heard of what had happened, and that whilſt he was purchaſing Land, he had bin like to have loſt his Heir to it, but he was glad to ſee me alive. I had good ſtore of Wine poured into my Belly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Water that was entred. We ſtaid there longer than was intended, for we attended the Burial of our friend, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Eſtate, had ſome time before made his Will, and made my Father his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſo that it was Gain and not Loſs to him; he then had his <hi>lucky days,</hi> and he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome miſt of them, but he being buried<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we returned for <hi>London,</hi> in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that we came, footed it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that puts me in mind of another Proverb, that <hi>the Father goes on Foot to buy Land, and the Son rides to ſell it.</hi> And ſo in truth it fell out, for he, as I told you, footed it thither and home agen; I ſince his Death did ride to ſell it, and he was not ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in the buying, nor ſo well pleaſed in his Purchaſe as I was in the ſelling, and I had ſome reaſon on my ſide, for he gave it me by his Will, but charged with ſuch an Incumbrance and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was to be made out of it,

that it was little worth, and I meeting with a man who had ſome other Eſtate adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and who had leſs need of ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney than I, gave me a great price for it, ſo that I never wiſh to ſell any thing dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than I did that.</p>
               <p>But to return, we being come to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and I returned to School, I had not continued there long, before I was in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to reſolve what Trade I ſhould be, for to be an Apprentice I muſt, and ſeeing that I was refuſed to be either of theſe two Trades that I had liked and named, would name no more, but left my ſelf to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers diſpoſing, who having of late had many occaſions to uſe a Scrivener in his Purchaſes, knowing that Trade to be not onely very uſeful, but profitable, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Trade to me, and I liking well the propoſition was ſoon provided of a Maſter.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Being placed out as an Apprentice, he gives an account of his Petty-ſervices, and how the Maid-ſervants though never ſo beggarly Baggages, have command over the Apprentice, and the Inconveniences that thereupon happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. He complains to his Father of his hard Uſage, but fares the worſe at preſent, and is ſoon after turn'd out of an Employment that had been of great Credit and Profit to him. He being found tardy in a ſmall Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor, is utterly diſgraced. His Mother dying after a ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and he thereby loſing his beſt Friend, reſolves to run away. He deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants upon this unlucky Reſolution, and adviſes all Servants to perform their Duties and truly ſerve out their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107141:29"/>
Times, leſt they falling into the like Misfortune as he hath done.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Maſter whom I was to ſerve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thirty Pounds in Money and eight years Service, or forty Pounds and ſeven years Service, beſides ſufficient Apparel: I who was then ſixteen years old, was unwilling to ſerve eight years; but my Father being willing to ſave ten pounds, did over-rule me, ſo that I was bound for eight years, and my Father was bound in a hundred pound Bond for my truth.</p>
               <p>All the good or ill fortune of my life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon my ſerving this eight years, which my unlucky Stars would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to do; and indeed I had ſome kind of reaſon on my ſide, which ought to have been weighed and conſidered before my binding; for my Maſter had two Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices more, and although he had a full employment, yet it was very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he would take any more ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, ſo that I was to be youngeſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice for moſt of my time, nay and it may be for all; for beſides the two other Apprentices who were elder than I, my
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107141:29"/>
Maſter had a Son about three years youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than I, whom he alſo deſigned to be of his own Trade, and by ſuch time as I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expected to have an Apprentice to come under me, my maſters Son was to ſupply that place, ſo that I was likely to be undermoſt all the time, and ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, that was the cauſe that I left my Maſter. But before I leave my Maſter, give me leave to tell you how I behaved my ſelf in his Service, and ſeveral paſſages that I think worthy of note.</p>
               <p>I was no ſooner bound, but I was told and ſhewed by him whom I ſucceeded what was my particular work, for beſides my Writing I was to do other Petty ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I was to make clean the Shooes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out the Aſhes and Duſt, ſweep the Shop, cleanſe the Sink (and a long naſty one it was) draw the Beer, at waſhing times to fetch up Coals, and Kettles, theſe were the within doors employs, and abroad, I was to go of all errands, and carry all burthens. I diſpenſed with all theſe matters, being told thereof by my Father and Mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I came, wherefore I was content, and did undergo all very willingly, till I had ſerved about three years, and then
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107141:30"/>
being grown up to ſome maturity and underſtanding, I began to grumble; I had Money given me which I always laid out in purchaſing of Books, eſpecially ſuch as treated of <hi>Knight Errantry,</hi> or elſe in buying ſomewhat to make me fine, and Money coming in pretty plentiful, I had bought me a very good Suit of Cloaths to wear by the by; and withal, being deſirous to appear in every thing like a Gentleman, I had a Watch for my Pocket; being thus accoutred, I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times went abroad with our Neighbour-Apprentices and others, and being thus fine, it troubled me that I muſt ſtill carry Burthens, for whoever went empty my Miſtreſs would ſtill take care that I had my Load to carry Working day and Sunday, from our <hi>London</hi> to our Countrey houſe, and rather than I ſhould want a Burthen, I was to carry earthen Pots and Pans, and Ox Livers, and Bones for the Dog, this I grumbled at, and when I have bin ſeriouſly a drawing Writings in the Shop, and ſtudying and contriving how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Covenants the beſt way, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Kitchin-wench would come and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb me with one of her Errants, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107141:30"/>
tell me I muſt fetch a <hi>farthing worth of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,</hi> or a <hi>pint of Vinegar,</hi> or ſome ſuch mechanical Story; nay, my Miſtreſs hath ſent me for a Pint of <hi>Purl,</hi> which when ſhe hath warmed and taſted of, and not liked, I muſt carry it again to change it. And I being the youngeſt Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was to be commanded by every one, the two eldeſt would appoint what I was to do in the Shop, and the Kitchin-wench would when ſhe pleaſed, command me into the Kitchin, ſo that I muſt be here and there and every where; and above all things, I muſt humor and pleaſe the Maid, or elſe ſhe would <hi>pick Holes in my Coat,</hi> and tell Tales of me to my Miſtreſs, who would not let me live a quiet hour. And now I am at this Point, give me leave to give you my Opinion in the Caſe: Me thinks it is a very unhandſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal thing, that Apprentices ſhould be thus uſed, for he that is an Apprentice at preſent, in ſhort time he is to be out of his time, and then he is a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his Maſter, and it may be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man than he; and why then ſhould he be thus tumbled and toſſed, and put to thoſe unhandſome Employments?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107141:31"/>
Why muſt the ſawcy Kitchin-wench com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, whom in few years ſhe would be glad to ſerve? And ſhe will be obeyed or elſe ſhe will be gone when ſhe pleaſes; when as the poor Apprentice is bound and muſt obey, he muſt ſtay his term out, and be obedient to the next <hi>Gilly-flurt</hi> that comes; and this is the reaſon that many times an Apprentice of very good and rich Parentage, to be rid of theſe ſlaviſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and taken-off from them, or be eaſed by the Maid, or have leave to make a Sop in the Pan, or for ſome ſuch greaſy Cupboard-Intereſt, falls into her Quarters, and then they make a marriage together, to the deſtruction of the poor young man, who does it that he may with the more eaſe paſs over the ſlavery of his Apprenticeſhip, whenas thereby he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves himſelf for ever.</p>
               <p>This is common between the Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and maid; but the Commands of the Daughters (if there be any) are much more inſupportable, unleſs by chance, they be good natured, but commonly your Citizens Daughters <hi>are better fed than taught,</hi> and by their Fathers and mothers Examples are ſurly and inſolent enough,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107141:31"/>
ſo that during all the time of the Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip, an Apprentice dares not look upon them, they are ſo proud and lofty that <hi>you can hardly reach their Ar—ſes with a Pitch-fork;</hi> and if when the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice writes <hi>Man,</hi> and wears good Cloaths, and Money in his Pocket, and comes near to the concluſion of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that his time is almoſt out; and then Courts them, feaſts and flatters them, yet they will ſtill ſcorn him; but if they ſhould proceed to Marriage, and if at any time after he offers to croſs or offend her Ladyſhip, then ſhe rants and rayls, and tells him He is a ſawcy proud Fellow, and that ſhe took him from cleaning her Shooes to be her Husband, <hi>She made her Diſh dout her Table-Cloath;</hi> And muſt ſhe be thus uſed by him? No, ſhe will not endure it; but he muſt, or elſe ſhe will make his Caſh fly, if ſhe can come at it, to ſpend upon good Fellows that will humour her, or elſe ſhe will throw up her Heels to the next good Fellow ſhe meets with, that he may ſpend upon her: And theſe are the Attendants of a <hi>London</hi> Apprentice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:107141:32"/>But for all that and notwithſtanding all that I have ſaid, or can ſay, yet I wiſh that I had weather'd the Poynt, that I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill on, bore the Apprenticeſhip to the end of the voyage; but it was my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune I was to be <hi>Unlucky,</hi> and therefore <hi>Unluckily</hi> I acted: For as I told you, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Son growing up, and being almoſt fit for buſineſs was taken home, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, and juſt when I expected an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to come and be under me, in ſteps he and was above me: This vexed me heavily, but much more when he became ſo inſolently proud, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to make clean his Shooes, and do more for him than formerly; So that I ſaw if the <hi>Dice did run ſo,</hi> that I was to be a Slave for all my time; I could not help it, I was bound to the ſowr <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-tree</hi> and there muſt abide by it, there was no <hi>Remedy</hi> but <hi>Patience,</hi> at which I was very impatient. And now my caſe was worſe than before, for the eldeſt Apprentice being lately out of his Time, and our Employment being great, I had been kept cloſe to my Writing, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from going on Errants, I had had a little ceſſation. But when my Maſters
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107141:32"/>
Son came into play, his putting in, was my putting out, I was again ſent to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bones to the Countrey Dog, and ſuch kind of idle ſcurvy Employments. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my Miſtreſs came one day to me and ſays, Sirrah, (for that was my Title with her) <hi>Come, leave your ſcribbling, for the Maids muſt waſh to morrow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt go and carry the foul Cloaths to the Countrey-houſe.</hi> I durſt not deny her, and therefore I aroſe, and went to take a view of my Luggage; It was large enough of all conſcience, but ſhe cauſing me to put on my Cloak, and finding that it was poſſible for me to carry more, called for all the dirty Clouts about the Houſe, and thruſt them in too: I ſeemed to grumble and mutter ſomething, but ſhe ſoon took me off by telling me I was proud and idle; ſo that I ſeeing it muſt be ſo, up I took the burthen, and away I went, but not to the Countrey-houſe, but made a ſhorter trip of it, I made my Journey ſomewhat ſhorter. I had often told my Mother of my grievances, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of carrying Burthens, but ſhe would not believe that I was put to do more than was fitting; wherefore I was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107141:33"/>
minded now to ſhew her, and therefore went ſtraight home to her Houſe, and laying down my Burthen, I asked if ſhe would now believe me, and whether I was put to Apprentice to carry ſuch Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens? She ſeeing the bulk and weight, and concluding it was unfit for me to be ſo uſed, bid a poor Journyman of theirs to take it and carry it forme. He throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on his Shoulder, we merrily trud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on together; when I came to the Countrey houſe, I took it and carried it in, and my Miſtreſs not being there, I had the good luck to return empty hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was a thing befel me very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had not been ſo then, had ſhe been there; and we returned merrily back, for I was then Maſter of Money enough, and therefore to a <hi>Two-Pot Houſe</hi> we went, and I gave my fellow traveller his skin full of Ale; he being thus feaſted, promiſed his good word to my Father; for, ſays he, it is not fit that you ſhould carry ſuch Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; I ſeeing him in the Cue, told him of many other grievances, all which he ſaid were not to be endured, and that he would ſo acquaint my Father with them, that they ſhould be remedied; thus was I
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107141:33"/>
in hopes that my Father would take ſome care in it, as I preſently found he had, but I was little the better for it; for no ſooner was I come into my Maſters Houſe, but he ſeeing me, enters his Cloſet, from whence fetches a <hi>luſty Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107141:34"/>
till he was again weary, and then there being a ceſſation of Arms down I ſate me not daring to ſpeak a word, but though I ſaid nothing, yet I paid it with thinking, but all to little purpoſe, he was Maſter, and I found ſo he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
               <p>I was now in bad plight, being afflict in Body by my Rib-roaſting, and in mind to conſider that by ſeeking a Remedy, I found the Cure worſe than the Diſeaſe. And my Maſter not thinking himſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently revenged in what he had done, was reſolved to proceed further, and afflict me in the moſt ſenſible part, ſo that all that was paſt was in compariſon to it, <hi>but a Flea biting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have told you that my Maſter had a large Employment, and withal, a place which he officiated, which brought in his greateſt profit. To the management of which he kept a Clark under him, which at preſent was my ſelf; for when my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Fellow prentice, who had aſſiſted him in it before me, was by means of the profit he gained in it grown proud and high flown, he then turned him out, and put me in, and now was I ſerved in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107141:34"/>
ſame manner, I was turned out, and his Son entred: Here I was the moſt ſenſibly afflicted, for I had my profit and credit both taken from me at once; but it could not be helped, and therefore Patience was my onely Remedy: Neither was this all my Misfortunes; for when I went to my Fathers houſe, I was like to have had as much from him as I had of my Maſter, for if my Father made one Complaint, my Maſter had told him of twenty of my Faults; as that I was proud, idle, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent, croſs, and many more ſuch kind of raſcally Epethites; ſo that I found that when I came to my Fathers with my Burthen, I had bin better to have taken a Coach and have carried it that ways, as I had done many times before, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unlucky</hi> ran my ſelf into this Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which being followed by another that cauſed me to leave my Service; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus turned out of my place of profit, was both troubled and angry, and was every day more and more afflicted, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by my Miſtreſs, who pryed into all my Actions to find ſomewhat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to accuſe me, and it was not long e're ſhe found ſomewhat that ſhe thought
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107141:35"/>
was very conſiderable, we had made ſome Conveyances of Land for a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who belike had not very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my Maſter in his payment, for he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occaſion to have them copyed, and deſiring my Maſter to get them done for him; my Maſter refuſed it, telling him we were ſo buſie that it could not be done. I hearing this, took the matter at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and privately told the Gentleman, that if my Maſter would not, yet I would get them done, and that by his time, and by this means, I intended to hedge in half a piece into my own Pocket; the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man and I agreed, and I undertook the buſineſs, but in regard the Writings were large, I could not conveniently do them all at home, I gave out a part to be done by another hand; in my Maſters abſence I writ ſome of theſe Writings, and ſtill as I did it, I lock'd it up in a Trunk, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not above a foot long, I kept it ſtill by me, and in it was all my Money and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; I did not carry my buſineſs ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, but my Miſtreſs who watched me, ſaw what I did, and my Maſter coming home acquainted him with it, he being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to diſcover this Myſtery, ſent me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107141:35"/>
on a pretended Errand, and in the mean time ſeizes on my Trunk; I while I was forth, met with one to whom I owed ſome Money, who I bid come home with me, and I would pay him, but when I came home, I could find no Money nor Trunk, I tumbled and toſs'd, but to no purpoſe, <hi>I fretted like gum'd Taffata,</hi> conſidering that if it ſhould come to my Maſters Hands, he would make a bad conſtruction of my Actions if he ſhould ſee what was in it; my Maſter all this while ſeeing how I was teez'd, laugh'd at me, and at length asking me what was the matter? I told him I had loſt my Trunk, in which he knew my Money was; well, ſaid he, if that be all, ſure you can remedy yourſelf, you have ſtudied <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> you were beſt to caſt a Figure for it; I replyed that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, indeed, I knew ſomewhat in that Art, yet I was not ſo good a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient as to anſwer ſuch a Queſtion: Well, ſaid he, If you cannot I will help you, do you but caſt a Figure for the Key, and I will caſt one for the Trunk. I hearing him ſay ſo, and then knowing very well, what of Courſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107141:36"/>
muſt neceſſarily follow, and that I ſhould be diſcovered in my Contrivance, I was as blank as a <hi>Bell-founder,</hi> but he by my unwillingneſs believing the matter to be greater than it was, was therefore the more earneſt, and I was forced to deliver him the Key, with which he opening the Trunk, diſcovered about ſix ſheets of Paper of my thus Copying: How now! <hi>What means this?</hi> ſaid he, I thinking it was no boot to make Excuſes, told him the whole truth, but as I made it at the beſt, it was a hainous matter to him, and no leſs than Felony in his Wife's opinion; I was forced to let them ſay all that they would, and give them the hearing; but however, I did not think my ſelf to be ſo errant a cheating Raſcal as they ſaid I was. The buſineſs is plain, I leave it to the Readers to judge, and ſo I will have done with this paſſage, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them to tell my Father of when ever they ſhould ſee him.</p>
               <p>But now about this time, one of the greateſt Misfortunes of my life befel me, for I loſt my loving and dear Mother, and that after a ſtrange manner.</p>
               <p>She was deſired by one of her friends
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107141:36"/>
to go with her to the Hoſpital, to ſee her Maids Breaſt (which was cancer'd) cut off; ſhe went and ſaw it, but took ſuch a conceit with it that coſt her her life, for ſhe preſently at the very inſtant of cutting off the Maids Breſt, felt a pain and pricking in her own, which increaſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and though her Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations did all they could to perſwade her to leave this Conceit, telling her that it was onely ſo, yet ſhe would not be wrought upon, but being given to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious melancholly, this Conceit ſo wrought upon her, that it proved what ſhe conceited it, and her Breſt was really cancer'd, and that in ſuch manner, that notwithſtanding all the Remedies ſhe took, it in few Months kill'd her.</p>
               <p>Thus did I loſe a dear, loving, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Mother, and one whom I have often bewailed, yet never ſufficiently, and here in this very place, I ſhould again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail her in verſe, but that as I have told you, I was ſo ſlenderly encouraged in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fifying, that they always come hard-bound from me, and therefore my <hi>Muſe</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free, and I being in haſte, I will omit them.</p>

this Action I was ſoon deprived of all; my ſmall Stock was not a Myne, it was ſoon waſted, I turned out of my Place, and all I could now ſay was <hi>Regnavi,</hi> I was in better State and Condition; but now Repentance comes too late. And all this hapned to me becauſe I was an inconſiderate <hi>Coxcomb;</hi> I was grown too proud, and it was very true as my Maſter ſaid: I wanted neither Meat, Drink, nor Apparel, I was in a place of Credit, and loſt all for a proud pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Humour, becauſe I could not have my will, and that is commonly the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of all People, and yet every one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires it.</p>

               <p>He being gone, I did not take much time to conſider what was beſt to be done, for I was reſolved to proceed in my Voyage, and have a little ſport and pleaſure, and took his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from out of the Countrey, to be a very good providence for me;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107141:41"/>
for I judged I ſhould be the welcomer to thoſe friends I intended to viſit, and did ſuppoſe that my Father underſtanding I was gone to look him, would not take it much amiſs, and that he would in my abſence diſcourſe with my Maſter, and it may be conclude upon terms to my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>Theſe were my thoughts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having taken a Boat, which was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to put off, away we went, ten Miles we were carried by water, and then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to foot it, for it was to <hi>Windſor,</hi> the ſame place where I had formerly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped drowning; and now being on ſhore, I found there was three of the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>viz.</hi> two Men and a Woman that were to go to the ſame place, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to foot it as I did; whereupon being glad of each others company, away we put on, we travelled very merrily, <hi>I caſt away care and was blith and bonny,</hi> for having Money in my Pocket, I thought my ſelf to be as good a man as the beſt.</p>
               <p>One of the two Men was ſomewhat melancholly, and he told us the cauſe was thus.</p>
               <p>Said he, It is not three Months ſince I
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107141:41"/>
travelled this way with a merrier heart and better Equipage, for I being a <hi>Citizen of London,</hi> went bravely mounted and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred, travelling all the Weſt parts of <hi>England</hi> where I dealt, to viſit my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and gather in Moneys, which I did in a good moderate manner, but not ſo conſiderably as the neceſſity of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs required; for no ſooner was I come to <hi>London,</hi> but I had all my Creditors came upon me, and <hi>dunn'd me ſo deſperately,</hi> that all that I could do at preſent did little with them, ſo that I had Actions daily, and at length a <hi>Statute of Bankrupt</hi> came upon me, that like a <hi>Deluge</hi> ſwept away all, onely I ſaved one Chapmans Book, and thereby have ſome hopes that thoſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that owe me Money, and which my Creditors know not of, will be ſo honeſt and kind to me as to pay me, with which I intend to ſet up in ſome other place.</p>
               <p>He having told his Tale, I looked ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly upon him, and could not gheſs him to be what he ſaid he was, <hi>a Citizen,</hi> for he was in a very different Habit, being <hi>Forreſter</hi> like cloathed all in green, but he aſſuring me that the Caſe was juſt ſo, and relating to me ſeveral particulars of his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107141:42"/>
Misfortune, I concluded him to be an <hi>Unlucky Citizen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this my <hi>Green Citizen,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, who was a <hi>London</hi> Cook, and his Wife; we deſigning all for one place, <hi>Windſor,</hi> and having come by Water to <hi>Brainford,</hi> and now having two Miles to <hi>Hounſtoe,</hi> I was reſolved to continue my Journey, but we all concluded to ſtop there for that Night, and the next morning to proceed on our way; wherefore we took up our Quarters at an Inn, and having eaten our Supper, went to Bed; the Man and his Wife in one Bed, and I and the <hi>green Citizen</hi> in another; I having caſt away care, ſlept ſoundly till it was near morning, when I was diſturbed with a very loud and ſhrill Shriek, and the noiſe of womens tongues which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed, and were indeed mixed with it. I being thus awakened, liſtned to hear what was the matter, but although the noiſe was cloſe by, as but in the Gallery at our Chamber door, yet I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand but little what they ſaid, and leſs what they meant; but the Cooks Wife who lay with her Husband in the ſame Chamber with us, told him, that if ſhe were not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107141:42"/>
miſtaken ſhe knew the voice of one of them and therefore ſhe would riſe to ſee what was the matter; ſo thereupon ſlipping on her Pettycoats and Shooes, opening our Chamber door, went to them; when ſhe was come thither, one of the women ſeeing her, began to ſhriek out again; but our Chamber-fellow told her ſhe needed not fear, for it was ſhe her Neighbour; <hi>O Lord Neighbour!</hi> ſaid the other, I have bin almoſt frighted out of my wits; ſo be like, ſaid the Cooks Wife, you would not have made ſo great a noiſe elſe: By this time ſeveral other Gueſts of the Houſe being awakened with the clamor, were alſo come to ſee what was the matter; whereupon our Cooks Wife being a witty Baggage, and being leſs concern'd than the reſt, and therefore her judgment more free to know what was moſt convenient, deſired all the parties concern'd to take their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or ſome one Chamber to retire from the company, for the woman who ſeemed to be moſt frighted was almoſt naked; this propoſition being thought convenient, they went into a Chamber, and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers retired, onely our Cooks Wife ſtaid with them. This paſſage I heard as I lay
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107141:43"/>
in Bed; and now it being day light we all aroſe, and our Cooks Wife came into our Chamber to put on her Clothes, we all asked her What was the matter? But ſhe could not tell us for laughing, we wondring at what had hapned, importuned her to acquaint us with the Adventure; ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſhe could not do it fully as yet, but did not queſtion but ſhe ſhould by and by, and all that we could get from her at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent was, that two Women were ſcar'd with living Ghoſts; this was all ſhe told us, and ſo having haſtily dreſs'd her ſelf, ſhe went again to her affrighted Acquaintance; and I being curious to know the truth of this Affair, went into their company, but I was never the wiſer, all that I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve was, that the Company conſiſted of an <hi>old Man, a Citizen,</hi> two young Women, and two young Men, who although they kept at a diſtance from the reſt, and they two were like Strangers to one another, yet I ſuppoſed that they were ſomewhat concerned with the Women; I found that although one of the Women and one of the Men, had deſigned to go with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to <hi>London,</hi> yet they did not, telling him that they would go by Water, this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107141:43"/>
was all I could diſcover while we ſtaid there; but we having broken our Faſts, and being reſolved on our Journey, away we marched; no ſooner had we left the Town on our Backs, and we entred <hi>Houn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſloe Heath,</hi> but we all three at once renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Requeſts to the Cooks Wife to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with the truth of the Adventure; ſhe laughing refuſed us, and our, nor her Husbands importunity would not for a long time prevail; but at length we ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned her, that ſhe conſented; but when ſhe went to begin, ſhe could not ſay one word for laughing; this heightned our expectations, and much concerned we were to know that which for a long time ſhe could not tell us, but at length having ſettled her ſelf, and bethinking what ſhe ſhould ſay, and how to begin, ſhe did it in this manner.</p>
               <p>I know not whether I ſhall give you the ſatisfaction you expect, for I'le aſſure you though I think I know all my ſelf, yet what I do know is ſo confuſed, that I can hardly tell how to begin my Diſcourſe, nor when I have begun, how to continue it in any Method to your ſatisfaction, but if you'l take the <hi>good Will for the Deed,</hi> I ſhall give you all the content that I can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:107141:44"/>And thus (ſaid ſhe) it is, I ſuppoſe (ſaid ſhe) to her Husband, that you know that two of the Parties, <hi>viz.</hi> the old man, and one of the young women, are Mr. ſuch a one and his Wife, our Neighbours; yes, replied the Cook, and I underſtand the other young woman is her Siſter, and this is all I know or can underſtand, although I believe the two young men are of their company; you are in the right, ſaid the Good-wife, and now you know thus much, I will tell you the reſt.</p>
               <p>One of theſe two young men (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſhe is a Sweet-heart or Servant, what you pleaſe to tearm it, of the old mans Wife, and hath courted her for enjoyment, whether they were ever at the ſport or no formerly, I know not, but laſt night I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they were, for I underſtand the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be thus:</p>
               <p>This young woman having agreed to content her Servant, and they intending to have a Frollick together, ſhe hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the old man her Husband, to give her leave to take a journey into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to ſee her Siſter, which is the other young woman; the Husband for a long time either refuſed her, or made excuſes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107141:44"/>
that he would in ſhort time ſpare ſo much time as to go with her; but ſhe not being deſirous of his company, had purpoſely ask'd him at the time of his greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, when he could not be ſpared from his buſineſs, and did importune him ſo much, that in the end ſhe gained his conſent; and he like a loving Husband, ſince he could not ſpare time to go with her all the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; did however, reſolve to accompany her the firſt days journey, and there to leave her to travel with other good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: She acquainted her Gallant with this Agreement, and they two concluded, that ſo ſoon as the old man, her Husband left her, he ſhould meet her, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her the reſt of the journey, where they paſſing for Man and Wife, might lie together upon the way, and frollick it to their own hearts content.</p>
               <p>Thus I underſtand was this Deſign laid, and yeſterday it was put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the old man and his Wife came laſt night to our Inn, as you well know, and were there met by the young man, the Gallant; who although he ſeemed before her Husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to know her, but yet they had together their private
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107141:45"/>
Conference, and he not having patience to ſtay till the old man left her, importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her ſo hardly, that in the end (his Lodging-Chamber being near hers) ſhe promiſed to take her opportunity, and leaving the old Mans Bed, come to Bed to him: In order to which, ſhe thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged her Affairs.</p>
               <p>The old Man was very weary with his unaccuſtomed travel, and withal ſleepy, deſirous to go to Bed, but ſhe kept him up, pretending much care and love of his Health, made him drink mull'd Sack, and when he was in Bed, cauſed him to eat a Sack-poſſet, and all ſuch kind of things, as intricating his Brain, ſhould cauſe him to ſleep the more ſoundly; ſhe had her deſires, for no ſooner was his Head laid on his Pillow but he fell aſleep, and although ſhe made haſte to undreſs her ſelf, yet when ſhe came to Bed, he ſnored, and <hi>was as faſt as a Pillar;</hi> ſhe lay ſtill for ſome time, but he ſleeping on, and ſhe attempting to wake him, but in vain, ſhe thought it a convenient time to perform her promiſe with her Gallant; wherefore turning out of the Bed, and onely putting on a white Smock-petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107141:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhe left her Husband aſleep, and leaving her Chamber door put to a char, ſhe went to her Gallants Chamber door, and found that in the ſame condition, and him ready to receive her; ſhe without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſwaſions went to Bed to him, but what they did together, or whether he pleaſed her or not, I'le leave you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and judge; for there ſhe ſtaid until it was almoſt morning, and then in the ſame Equipage ſhe left his Bed and Chamber to go to her Husbands; but although it was not far off in the ſame Gallery, yet juſt as ſhe was at our Chamber door, being in the middle way, ſhe was met by a man, who having a Candle in his hand, was followed by a woman in a countrey Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit ready dreſs'd; ſhe ſeeing this, and looking earneſtly on the Countrey-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans face, and withal knowing it, for it was her Siſter, that very Siſter ſhe was going to viſit; ſhe being amazed at the encounter, gave a great Shriek: The Countrey woman hearing the Shriek, partly knowing the voice, and with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs looking on the face, and ſeeing it all in white, did alſo ſhriek out: You may imagine the cauſe of both their ſhrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107141:46"/>
for the old Mans Wife ſeeing her Countrey Siſter at that time and place, thought it was her Ghoſt, which came to meet and chide her for playing that foul play <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> her Husband, which ſhe had ſo lately done.</p>
               <p>And on the other hand, the Countrey Siſter being <hi>of the ſame Mettle,</hi> for there was <hi>never a Barrel better Herring,</hi> who had alſo been guilty of the ſame fault; for ſhe as well as her City Siſter, had had her Gallant, not onely that night, but many more, during all the journey, having ſet out from the good Countreyman her Husband upon the ſame terms as her City Siſter had done. This good Countrey-woman, I ſay thus meeting with a thing all in white, ſo like a Ghoſt, at ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable time, and ſo unexpected a place, ſhe was ſtrucken with fear, and ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in conſcience, conceiting that this was her Siſters Ghoſt; (for ſhe believed her dead) that came to chide and correct her for her diſloyalty to her Husband.</p>
               <p>This (ſaid the Cooks Wife) was the cauſe of their ſudden and ſhrill ſhrieks, and their fear and aſtoniſhment was ſo great, that they were not out of it till I came to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107141:46"/>
them, and cauſed them to enter their Countrey-womans Chamber, which was thought the moſt convenient for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now being come thither, it was then a long time before their fear was over, and that they had ſo far recollected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as to know what had hapned, and then they both knew of their own guilt, but not of one anothers; but I having asked them ſeveral Queſtions, which they ſo unhandſomely and uncertainly anſwered, that I having at length <hi>got hold of the Thread in the end from the Needle,</hi> and being acquainted with part of their Stories, knew the reſt; for my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the Citizens Wife enjoyning me to ſilence, told me her naked Story; and as for the others, I could not miſs of it, becauſe the Tapſter, Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and others of the Inn, termed the young Man that was with the Countrey-woman, her Husband, for ſuch they had paſſed, and lain together ſince their firſt coming out.</p>
               <p>This was to be concealed from the old Citizen, who knowing his Brother-in-law,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107141:47"/>
the Countreyman, was not to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with this young man; wherefore they contrived the matter ſo, as all was to be concealed from him, as indeed it was, and he being now up, and told of his Wife's being frighted; ſhe made an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and ſaid, ſhe onely did riſe to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gallery and ſee if it were day, and what weather it was; and there, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that occaſion it was, that ſhe meeting her Siſter was ſo affrighted, as occaſioned this alarm to the whole houſe.</p>
               <p>This paſſed for a very good excuſe to the old man, and he was very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and pleaſed that they had ſo luckily met his Wife's Siſter there, and thereby ſaved his Wife a journey, and him much money, that would have been ſpent in that viſit.</p>
               <p>But if he was pleaſed, I believe his wife and her Gallant were of another mind; they were troubled that their whole deſigns were croſs'd; but they may thank themſelves, their over much haſte was the onely cauſe of all, for it they had had ſo much patience, as to have lain aſunder for that night, all this had not hapned; for the Countrey Siſter would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107141:47"/>
have been gon with the Carrier towards <hi>London</hi> long before they had riſen, but <hi>ſelf do, ſelf have,</hi> it hath hapned croſs upon their own occaſion.</p>
               <p>And thus did the Cooks wife finiſh her ſtory, to our great admiration, and her great joy, for ſhe again fell a laughing, and we accompanied her in the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, many times deſcanting on the ſeveral particulars of this Adventure. She having finiſhed, and we having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all that was convenient on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I did conclude that I might very well reckon, our old man that had this light-heel'd Wife, to be an <hi>unlucky Citizen.</hi>

               <p>I anſwered, that indeed the News was very unexpected, and that I was much troubled at it; I pray'd him to come in, and told him he was welcome; he ſaid that although he had brought me ſad News, yet he had done but his part, he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107141:50"/>
could not help it, and that he loved my Brother ſo well, that he would have done any thing to have ſaved his life; but ſince he was dead, he ſhould for his ſake, be as ready to aſſiſt me and his Wife: I kindly thanking him, again told him he was well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and that I would go to my Siſter with all ſpeed; I deſired this Countrey-man to remain at my houſe whilſt he ſtaid in <hi>London;</hi> he kindly accepting of my offer, told me that he ſhould ſtay about two or three days, and in that time he hoped I would be ready to go with him; I underſtanding by him that my Brother was buried, thought that I might ſtay the longer, and being determined when I was out, to travel farther amongſt my Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and Chapmen; I therefore ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to a Taylor to make me ſome Mourning, I alſo being much in debt, ſent to my Creditors, and told them that my Brother was dead, and had left me half his Eſtate, that I was to go to <hi>Oxford</hi> where he had lived, and look after it; that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to go further and gather in debts, and that I hoped by this journey, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Money enough to ſatisfie them all.</p>

               <p>Now conſidering that if I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Money very freely and abundantly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107141:51"/>
of my Chapmen, I ſhould return with a heavy heart, but then bethinking my ſelf of my Brothers ſudden death, and withal of the Eſtate he had left me, I was both ſorry and pleaſed; ſorry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his loſs, and pleaſed with the conceit of increaſing my Eſtate, which I thought would be very conſiderable by that Addition, and thus ruminating upon theſe things at length I ſell into a ſlumber.</p>
               <p>I had not ſlept long before I was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed with the noiſe of two Men that entred the Chamber; one I knew to be the Chamberlain, and the other being all in black, I knew not by the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, but when he turned about and ſaw his face, I cried out <hi>O Lord!</hi> and gave ſuch a Shriek as the Women did this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he in black hearing the noiſe, and looking very earneſtly upon me, who was by this time riſen upright in my Bed, gave as great a Shriek as I had done before. The Chamberlain hearing this, asked what was the matter? To this I replied, Do I ſleep, or do I wake, ſurely I dream? or elſe this is my dead Brother, Dead, ſaid he, truly I did imagine

you to be ſo, and that was the cauſe of my amazement, but Heavens be praiſed, it is otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>We now having heard one anothers ſpeech, and by that knowing that we were not Ghoſts, we joyned hands, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with much affection; ſaying at once, <hi>Oh my dear Brother!</hi> this being over.

               <p>I was amazed at what I read, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to what end all this would come, and taking my Breeches, and drawing from thence the Letter I had received, I gave it to my Brother, ſaying, read that, and then ceaſe wondring at what I have ſaid.</p>
               <p>He ſoon read over the Letter, and then cried out as well as I, What means theſe two Letters, ſomewhat there is intended, although the ſtory be falſe, ſomewhat is deſigned? And at the bottom of the ſtory, hereupon I told him of whom I received my Letter, and all the circumſtances;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107141:53"/>
he told me his, which were much the ſame, for upon deſcription we found the Meſſenger to be one and the ſame party, all that differed in either of the Stories was this; He had importuned my Brother to be gone the next morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe I lay unburied. That he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him in his houſe one night, and the next day giving him twenty Shillings as for his Charges, he departed well contented.</p>
               <p>Now could not we tell what to imagine was the buſineſs, for we could not think that any fellow for the getting of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings (for that was all that we could reckon off) would trouble himſelf to contrive theſe two Letters, and be at the Charge and trouble to ride or go from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We knew not what to reſolve on, nor indeed to think; but we reſolved on this, that for that night one Bed ſhould ſerve the turn, and we would lie together, and conſult what was to be done againſt the morning; whereupon he undreſſing himſelf came to Bed to me. But although we ſpent much time that night in diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on this ſubject, yet we could find nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107141:53"/>
Head nor Tale in it; wherefore we went to ſleep as well as our Cares would let us, and the next morning awaking, and conſulting what was neceſſary to be done, we both reſolved to continue our Journeys, he for <hi>London,</hi> and I for <hi>Oxford,</hi> for he had ſome buſineſs that engaged him to go to <hi>London,</hi> where I deſired him to cauſe my Servant to examine both Shop, Warehouſe, and Houſe, to ſee if he did not miſs any Goods, for I began to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that our Meſſenger might have had ſome Deſign upon them, which he might conveniently act whilſt he remained in my houſe.</p>
               <p>My Brother did accordingly, and I being neceſſitated to proceed in my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to my Chapmen did ſo too, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my Brother to make the ſame inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at his Houſe, as he was deſired to do at mine.</p>
               <p>And thus did we part, and I making very great haſte arrived the ſame day at <hi>Oxford.</hi>

of Confidence, having ſpent all his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony on young Women, was forced (for Eſtates ſake) to be at laſt content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an old one, for ſuch a one at length he married; by which means he had not onely a fair Eſtate with her, but ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a young Kinſwoman to whom ſhe was Guardian, he alſo in right of his Wife, had her to diſpoſe of; and her Eſtate being two thouſand Pounds which was likewiſe in his cuſtody.</p>
               <p>He having known the want of Money, although he was now Maſter of enough, yet was unwilling to part from ſo great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He having thought of many ways, at laſt reſolves upon one, the wickedeſt of any he could imagine (but all ways were alike to him, ſo as he might thereby attain his ends.) He concluded that if he could but Whore the Kinſwoman, he might ſave the Portion, or at the worſt, put her off with a part. To this end he courts her himſelf, and tells her, that the love to her cauſed him to marry with her Couſin and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and uſed many Arguments to this purpoſe.</p>

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:107141:59"/>She being of a virtuous inclination, and abhorring his propoſition, gave him ſuch an Anſwer as did become a modeſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to return to ſo foul a Queſtion; but he continuing his purpoſe, did ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proſecute and perſecute her, that ſhe acquainted his wife therewith; but to little purpoſe; for in ſtead of being daunted when his Wife told him of the lewdneſs of his Deſign; He commanded her on her obedience to him, to aſſiſt him if ever ſhe intended to live in quiet.</p>
               <p>His Wife underſtanding how wickedly he was bent, took a reſolution with her young Kinſwoman to manage Affairs ſo, as to gain both their contents, and in the end, as they hoped, reclaim him; and thereupon it was agreed, that at his next Addreſs to her, ſhe ſhould be more kind to him than formerly, and give him hopes of attaining his deſire.</p>
               <p>The young Maiden (though unwilling) conſented hereto, leaving the reſt to time and her Couſins diſcreet management thereof.</p>
               <p>This Maiden was not onely young, but handſome; ſo that ſhe was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her Servants that would willingly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107141:59"/>
court her, but could not, being hindred by this her lewd Kinſman; among the reſt, there was one who loved her, that was much ſuch another Blade as himſelf, for he was young and handſome, of good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, and well bred, onely he had been debauched with company; and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; with this of our wild Guardian. This young man frequenting the houſe to viſit him, had the greater liberty of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and courting her; but he knowing in part, the intent and purpoſe of his Companion the Guardian, durſt not be open in his courtſhip, what he did was cloſely, but withal, with pretty good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; for the Maiden was indifferently ſatisfied in him, and ſome Love ſhe had for him, and more it would have been but for her Guardians ſake, doubting he might prove as bad as he.</p>
               <p>Thus hid matters depend between all Parties for ſome time; but our Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ſtill proſecuting his deſign ſtill court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his young Kinſwoman in the vicious way; I have told you, ſhe by his Wifes directions admitted of his courtſhip, and at length agreed to let him have his will with her; the night, and time of night

was agreed on, as alſo the place her Chamber, the Terms were, that all ſilence ſhould be uſed on both parts, no light, not no other ways to diſcover her.</p>
               <p>The day was come that was to precede this night, as alſo the evening, when he as I have already told you, was engaged at his ordinary Receptacle, the <hi>Gaming Houſe,</hi> there was with him his Companion that courted the Maiden. Various were the ſucceſſes of the Gameſters; but it was the good fortune of the Suiter to win the moſt Money, and he being ſo wiſe as to know when he was well, he had the grace to give off a winner, and not to tempt the Dice further, ſo that he in good time left off; our Guardian had loſt all his money, and freſh Gameſters came in that had good ſtore; but our Suiter who had won, would not engage further; our Guardian who loved the ſport, was angry that he had no Money, wherefore he ſollicites the winner to lend him ſome; he did ſo, and then he began, a freſh, in which he was ſo deeply engaged, that although he remembred the aſſignation with his Kinſwoman, and that the hour was come, yet go he could not conſidering he had loſt ſo much money, and

might renewing his play recover it, but he was more certain he might have the wench, on the one hand he had <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> on the other <hi>Lechery,</hi> but all things conſidered, Money weigh'd the heavieſt, and he was reſolv'd to let go the preſent enjoyment of the Wench, in hopes of recovering his Money, he conſidered that another time might ſerve the turn with her; but then doubting if he loſt this opportunity and diſappoint her, ſhe might reſolve to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and ſo he loſe his deſign, again wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in his reſolution he thus conſidered, that if ſhe were Whor'd he had his ends, that he might not fail of this, he reſolved to let his friend who lent him the money take his turn, and have the uſe of the Wench, let him have fleſh for his money, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calls him aſide, in ſhort tells him the Story, and to recompence his kindneſs tels him he ſhould go in his ſtead, gives him the Key, and inſtructs him how he was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf. This was as it ſhould be, and our winning Suiter rejoic'd at his good luck, his <hi>lucky night</hi> was come, he had two fortunes at once, he had gained Money, and now was about to gain a Wench to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

courted and deſired, he wondred at the manner, and her temper, but was reſolved to proſecute his good fortune any way, and before he left her, to acquaint her with his Quality, and then he doubted not but ſhe would accept him in the honeſt way of Marriage. Theſe were his thoughts, theſe were his reſolutions, and ſo he went to try his Fortune.</p>
               <p>How he ſucceeded you ſhall know by and by; in the mean time the Gameſter failed of his purpoſe, it was his <hi>unlucky hour, nay, night,</hi> and he proſecuted his ill fortune, and before Morning loſt all his borrowed Money. This diſpleaſed him, and made him very melancholly; but the next morning when he ſaw his adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Companion, that had taken his turn, and ſaw him all blith, jocund, and merry, he was then ſad at the heart, to think how he had fool'd himſelf. After the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Salutations had paſs'd between them, they enquired of each others ſucceſs; Mine is as bad as bad can be, ſaid the Guardian; for I have loſt all; and mine pleaſant, ſaid the other, exceeding all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, Oh the braveſt Bed fellow that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Seen, replied the other, I hope you did not come to that, for then I am undone; No, replied the other, all the Articles were exactly performed, we had no Light, nor no Speech paſſed between us, but that was done that makes me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude her a brave, fine Woman; and I a fine Fool, ſaid the Guardian; yes, if you knew all, ſaid the Adventurer; for though I have had pleaſure in my days, yet never, never ſo ſweet a Skirmiſh! how like Ivy ſhe grew to my embraces! not a kiſs but had <hi>Elizium</hi> in't.</p>
               <p>This language was like ſo many Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles ſtuck into the fleſh of our Guardian, who too late repented of his folly, but he was reſolved to put in for a ſhare in the pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe two were in their diſcourſe, they were diſturbed by arival of the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians Wife, at whoſe approach the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer made his <hi>exit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was not onely in her Dreſs, but alſo in her Countenance more pleaſant and ſprightly than uſual. She coming up to him, ſaluted him moſt kindly, enquiring how he ſped the laſt night? He replied, not well, for he had loſt his Money; 'Tis
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107141:62"/>
not that Game I mean, ſaid ſhe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; wherein I hope you were pleaſed, and now you have had your ends you will turn honeſt; honeſt, ſaid he, Who charges me with diſhoneſty? That may I, ſaid ſhe, unleſs you'l ſay 'tis honeſt to leave my Bed and lie with my Kinſwoman: By Heavens, ſaid he, 'tis falſe I did not; How truely do you ſwear now (ſaid ſhe) unknown to you, for I am ſure you did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you had her all night in your Arms, but I out plotted you, and wrought ſo with my honeſt Couſin, that I ſupplied her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton place, that with ſome ſhame at laſt I might deceive your hard heart into kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He hearing her thus diſcourſe, grew mad with rage and anger to conſider what a <hi>Coxcomb</hi> he had been, and how he was fitted with a pair of Horns of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and did ſo rant and ſtorm, that his good Wife miſtaking his cauſe of anger, and judging it had been againſt her, when it was onely againſt himſelf; for his folly ſhe told him, that ſince all that ſhe could do would not work upon him, ſhe would acquaint the World with the whole ſtory; he knowing that would be the only way to diſgrace him, was forced to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

her into ſilence, promiſing an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And now he being ſatisfied what a Beaſt he was, and doubting that it would e're long be the <hi>Town-talk,</hi> he plotted how to patch up the matter, he again findes out his late Adventurer, and tells him he could not think his Kinſwoman ſo ſweet a Bed-fellow, the other ſtill commending her to the higheſt; he at laſt breaks out and makes this Propoſition, That if he did ſo like her, and would take her to his Wife, he would ſo mannage the matter, that ſhe ſhould accept of him for her Husband; Nay, but replyed the other, I ſhall not like her in that Quality, for a Miſtreſs ſhe is excellent, but I know her too well to truſt her with my Honour, eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how well ſhe loves and likes you; if it were ſo, I ſhould be ſure to be <hi>dubb'd Knight of the forked Order.</hi>

               <p>Our Guardian hearing him thus deſcant in theſe terms, ſighed to think that he had ſo well deſcribed his condition, and telling the other that he had now thrown off all vicious thoughts, and that if he would marry her and be ſilent, all ſhould be well, and he ſhould have her full Portion.</p>

and better pleaſed with my idle wanton Stories, than with my ſober advice to you, and practice them more than my good Counſel, you my chance to pay dear for it, as as you may find by the foregoing Examples. In all that I write I intend your profit, and that the Examples I give you, may ſerve as Sea marks to ſhow you how to ſteer your Courſe, ſo as to avoid thoſe Rocks and Shoals that I and others have faln upon.</p>
               <p>This is the end I aim at, I would both profit and delight you, I therefore thought good to mix thoſe of others with my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, all the Stories that you have been told, are to my Subject, <hi>Unlucky<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I think the Adventure of the Inn was ſo to all parties concern'd in it; that of the Draper and his Brother was <hi>Unlucky</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to them both, eſpecially to the poor Draper, for that very misfortune haſtened his ruine, and cauſed us to have his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the Equipage I have told you. The ſtory of the Guardian was <hi>Unlucky</hi> enough to him, eſpecially as he believed it to be till the Cataſtrophe, the concluſion of all and then he found all right again; if he had the grace to mend it was well, and I hope
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107141:68"/>
by his Example you will learn to avoid thoſe two dangerous Rocks of Wench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Gaming; one ſpoils the Pocket, and conſumes money and time; the other the Body and Reputation here, and the better part, the Soul, hereafter, if not timely repented of: but ſo much for that.</p>
               <p>And as for the laſt Story, which is indeed the idleſt, of the poor Wench and her Maſter, ſhe was <hi>Unlucky</hi> enough, for by ſeeking to avoid one Shame, which would ſoon have had an end, ſhe fell into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which brought a laſting Shame upon her, ſhe did not rightly conſider the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>of two Evils take the leaſt,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe did not chuſe, yet ſhe permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the greateſt, and thereby, as to the other Stories, I may give that the Title of <hi>Unlucky.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thought it convenient for varieties ſake to clap in theſe Stories, and I knew not where better, than in our Journey over <hi>Hounſloe Heath,</hi> they may paſs for good Paſtime, and for ſuch you may take them, applying them aright as I told you.</p>

would run for a Wager with me to a place at a Mile and a halfs diſtance.

knowing that if I gave it over I ſhould be laugh'd at, and if I undertook it, I might win, I was reſolved to try my fortune, and ſo I did, but I was <hi>Unlucky,</hi> I had been better to have ſtaid at home and have been laugh'd at for the loſs of my Money onely, than to be laugh'd at and abuſed too; for we began our Journey, and I, dark as it was out went my blind Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary till I came to a narrow way, and there I had my heels thrown up by a Rope which was laid croſs the way, and the two ends held by two Bumpkins on each ſide.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107141:75"/>
enough till morning, and then examining my Pockets I found them almoſt empty, I was ſorry and heavy for their lightneſs, and knew there was a neceſſity to repleniſh them, and bethought how: I had but two ways, the one, borrowing of ſome of my old Comerades, in which I was uncertain, and the ether was to ſell one of my Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, this was moſt feiſable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this I reſolved to do, and that ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; there was no great difficulty in doing it, for my Comerade whom I had the laſt night ſpoken with, was a Watch-makers Apprentice, of him I had bought the Watch and he I knew could ſoon ſell it for me again.</p>
               <p>I ſtaid all day in my Quarters, and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being come, <hi>like the Owl,</hi> I began my walk, I paſſed by ſeveral perſons that I knew, but durſt not ſpeak to them; I went to the place appointed for our Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz, and there I had not ſtaid long before I was viſited by my Watch-maker, who brought with him ſeveral other of our Comerades and Acquaintance; they were all joyed to ſee me, and I told them all the pleaſure of my Journey; we called for Drink and Victuals, and very merry we
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107141:75"/>
were, the company encreaſing ſtill as we ſtaid, for they had told one another, and all the Apprentices of our acquaintance came to ſee me, they were all in one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>une, complaining againſt the ſeverity of their Maſters, but none of them had been ſo much a <hi>Coxcomb</hi> as my worſhip, to run away and ramble.</p>
               <p>I told my Watch-maker, that having two Watches, I was willing to part from one; he hearing me ſay ſo, found me out a Cuſtomer of one of the company, who gave me to a farthing what it had coſt me.</p>
               <p>All this was well, and ſo like to be, for when the reckoning came to be paid, although it was conſiderable, yet I was to be excuſed, and not ſuffered to pay a farthing; the world went well on my ſide at preſent, for I was beloved by my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who all treated me with much kindneſs, they deſired to ſee me again the next night, and ſo for the preſent we parted.</p>
               <p>I went home to my Quarters with a light heart, being very well ſupplied with Money, I was ſuch a <hi>Coxcomb</hi> as to think that this would laſt me a long time,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107141:76"/>
I did not conſider that it would waſte apace, and that in ſhort time theſe my Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades would be weary of my company, eſpecially if when my Money was ſpent, I ſhould fall a borrowing of them; I did not conſider that they were furniſhed with Money by ſerving their Maſters, and that I was faln from that condition, and out of all ways of getting any. Theſe things I never thought of, all my ſtudy was to ſpend my Money in the idleſt company; for none but ſuch <hi>Idle-packs</hi> as my ſelf would keep me company, and ſuch I dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met with. I remember one Morning two fellows came in to my Landlords, and they comeing to drink their Mornings-draughts, and having as little buſineſs as my ſelf, I joined in company with them; we called for one pot after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till we were all <hi>bubby,</hi> and then we neither knew nor cared what we did, for we three drank on till we had for our Mornings-draught thrown down into our Bellies three Gallons apiece, I am ſure the Reckoning being ſix Shillings, I paid two of it, and we had all in dry drink; I ſuppoſe our Landlord did not cozen us, he was too good a fellow, he onely now
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107141:76"/>
and then drank one Cup with us, which we forced on him, for he knew whatever the Gueſts did, yet it was neceſſary for the Maſter of the Houſe to keep himſelf ſober, and ſo he did; but I was ſo fluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, that I lay down to ſleep, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Nap of two hours, I was not ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but that I made as ill an After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons work as my Forenoons had been before.</p>
               <p>I having well drench'd my Guts in the Morning, was deſirous of ſome Provant, and asked my Landlady what ſhe had in the Houſe? She anſwered me that ſhe was at that time but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly provided, I had ſlept away my Dinner-time, and that then there was nothing left in the Houſe but Bread and Butter.</p>
               <p>I being very much troubled at her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, for my Guts grumbled, <hi>Colon</hi> would be ſatisfied, and Bread and Butter was but ſlender fare.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was thus diſputing with my Landlady upon theſe affairs, there entred the room a neat ſpruce young Wench, I having often ſeen her to trip it up and down, making many flurting Errands
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107141:77"/>
into our houſe; I underſtood that ſhe lived at the next door, and was a Working wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, either a <hi>Bonelace maker, Button-maker,</hi> or <hi>Bandſtring-maker,</hi> one of theſe three Trades I remember ſhe was; as alſo, that ſhe was then ſpruce, neat, and tight, ſhe had a face as ſmug as if ſhe had been uſed to waſh it with <hi>Beef broath,</hi> or <hi>Puppy-dog Water;</hi> but above all, her forehead ſhined and was as ſlick, as if it had been rub'd with a <hi>Slick-ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This pretty little <hi>Calf with a white face</hi> entring the Room at ſuch time as I was diſputing the caſe about Victuals, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that there was none that I liked, ſhe told me that if I loved Cakes, I might have very good ones three Doors off</p>
               <p>I hearing her Propoſition, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her Countenance, and now having drink in my Brain, had a months mind to be kiſſing of this <hi>Harlotry;</hi> wherefore I ſoon replied to her, that although I did not much care for Cakes, yet I would ſend for ſome, provided ſhe would ſtay and help to eat them; ſhe anſwered, that ſhe would bear me company; and ſo I ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her, cauſed her to ſit down by me.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107141:77"/>
I ſent for half a dozen Cakes, but could not at preſent have them, becauſe they were then in the Oven, but would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ready, wherefore in the mean time, I called for a Pot of Ale, and drank to my <hi>pretty little Miſtreſs;</hi> ſhe pledg'd me, and by that time the Ale was off, the Cakes were brought in piping hot, I ſeeing that, called for the Butter, and fell too, and ſo did ſhe ſo luſtily, that in a pair of Minutes our ſix Cakes were inviſible, I underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were but penny Cakes, called for a dozen more, and thoſe held us tack for a while, but ſoon after, one of my little <hi>Baggages</hi> Companions coming in, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her helping hand to the work, they all vaniſhed in a moment.</p>
               <p>I being reſolved to have enough, called for ſix more to make my Money even, they were brought, and then my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady put in, and all was quickly gone and my company not ſatisfied, their Bellies were not full they told me, then they ſhall ſaid I, if all the Cooks Cakes can do it, and thereupon I ſent for the whole Batch: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t was inſtantly brought me, and all being ſix dozen, amounting to ſix ſhillings; <hi>I paid down the Cole,</hi> and then we renewed our

eating, all my Gueſts conſiſting of my young Miſtreſs, her Companion, and my Landlady, laughed at the frollick, and ſaid they ſhould not know what to do with ſo many, but I found that they lied, for in leſs than one hours time, they with their nimble Chops, and lighter fingers, had ſo plaied <hi>Legerdemain,</hi> that they were all invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, not one left to throw at a Dog, ſome they eat, and the reſt they pocketed, and made a clean riddance of all, and ſoon after I was rid of my Wench; for ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was no more employment for her Chops or Hands, ſhe gave me the go by, and march'd off.</p>
               <p>And thus did I finiſh my days work, which was none of the worſt that I have had, but I remember this for the Cakes ſake, and the Wenches together.</p>
               <p>And now truly Reader I have much wondred that I ſhould ſo perfectly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this Adventure of the Cakes, being ſo inconſiderable a fooliſh Story, and done ſo long ſince, for it is above twenty years ago: But here ſome waggiſh Readers will be apt to <hi>meaſure my Corn by their Buſhel,</hi> and to judge that I had ſome cauſe to think of this ſtory, and that more for the Wenches
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107141:78"/>
ſake than the Cakes, and that it is poſſible that if I gave her <hi>Cake-bread,</hi> ſhe was ſo cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable as to give me <hi>fleſh</hi> in exchange; I tell thee Reader, it was no ſuch matter, I utterly deny it, for I do not remember that I ever kept company or drank with her before or after; it may be I might if I would, there wanted nothing but a little entreaty, but aſſure your ſelf I proceeded no further; I always dreaded that ſort of Cattle, ſuch as thoſe that were Maids, or did paſs for ſuch, and were of a lower form ſuch as were ſervants, and had nothing but what they wrought for; I had this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in my eye, that I ſhould one day have ſome Eſtate, and that a conſiderable one, if my Father and I did not wholly fall out, and I knew that if I ſhould deal with thoſe kind of Gypſies, and they ſhould prove, and I by fair means or foul ſhould be drawn to marry them, that then I ſhould loſe my Father for good and all: I had the grace to have theſe two thoughts, or elſe I had been caught while I lived at my Maſters, for there we had a Maid or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſervant, who would hear my Tale, and take part with me, ſhe would diſcover my Maſter and Miſtreſſes Deſigns whatſoever
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107141:79"/>
againſt me, and all the ſecrets of the Houſe were laid open to me, ſhe would alſo be ſure to lay by many a good bit for me, and make many excuſes for me; by this means ſhe wriggled her ſelf into my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and I accounted her my very good friend, and as occaſion offered treated her abroad; ſhe aiming at ſomewhat further, was as free with me as I could wiſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and we often ſported and toy'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we proceeded ſo far that I knew ſhe had <hi>a Blot on her Tables,</hi> ſhe had <hi>a Point open,</hi> and ſhe knew that I had a <hi>Man to enter,</hi> and ſo I might if I would but I durſt not, but ſhutting up the Tables, proceeded no further in the Game.</p>
               <p>I was fearful of what I have told you, and durſt not meddle, and it was well I did not, for if I had, I had been caught: The Baggage vexing heartily at my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and giving out ſomewhat of me though untruly; for I proteſt ſhe and I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med no further; I knew if I won at firſt, I might, nay ſhould loſe at laſt; I knew the quality of thoſe kind of Cattle too well; for if any young man, an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, be ſo ſilly as to fall into ſuch a Wenches Quarters and marry her, if an
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107141:79"/>
old rich fellow gets to bed to his Servant-maid, or any of theſe unequal matches happen, as they do too often, that man is ſure to be undone, theſe beggarly Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages are preſently <hi>Cock-a-hoop,</hi> ſet them a horſeback and you know where they will ride; my good Angel ſtill kept me from ſuch kind of <hi>ill luck;</hi> I had Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes enough beſides that, and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I avoided, and ſo I adviſe thee to do, and thus I conclude the Adventure of the Wench and the Cakes.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BUt as wiſe as I was in this Caſe, I was ſtill fool enough in the main, I ſtill held out in my ſtubborneſs, I would not go near either my Maſter or Father, but ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at home at the Cooks houſe all day, and ſpending my Time and Money in ſmooth Ale, and in the evening taking a turn to our Rendezvouz, and meeting ſome of my Comerades, this was my whole employment; ſome of my Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades complained ſo heavily of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſeverity, that I expected them to take the ſame courſe as I had done, and keep me company, and ſo they promiſed me, but they had more Grace.</p>
               <p>I enquired how my Maſter took my abſence, of ſome of our neighbours, but they could not tell me any particulars, but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107141:80"/>
they told me if I had a mind to ſee, and ſpeak with my fellow Apprentice, he ſhould give me a meeting; I was willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſee him, but fearful of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traid to my Maſter, but they engaged the contrary, and I conſented: The next night he came, and ſaid he was glad to ſee me, asking me how I fared? I made the beſt of a bad Market, and bragg'd of the brave life I led, he ſeemed diſpleaſed, wiſhing he had taken my turn, I to myſelf wiſhed it with all my heart, and began to repent; but when he told me of paſſages betwixt my Father and Maſter, (for they had met and diſcourſed the matter) then I was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified beyond meaſure, it appeared to me like <hi>raw Head and bloody Bones;</hi> for my Father ſaid, my Maſter muſt and ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me; my Maſter replied, that I ſhould firſt take a turn in <hi>Bridewel:</hi> I was accuſed and threatned on all ſides; my Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his ſon, and ſaid he would force my Maſter to find and keep him; then it ſhall be in <hi>Bridewel,</hi> ſaid my Maſter, and ſtill the burthen of the Song was <hi>Bridewel.</hi> I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, and underſtanding that they both knew of my being in Town, was reſolved on another journey, hoping at my return
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107141:81"/>
to find them both agreed, or at worſt, in better temper; I wanted nothing but the principal Verb, <hi>Money,</hi> neither was I in any great want, for I had three pound of the five pound I ſold my Watch for, in my pocket; but however, not knowing my own mind, whither I ſhould go, or how long I ſhould ſtay, I thought it convenient to ſee how much more I could raiſe by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing; and therefore putting on a bold face, I asked one to lend me forty ſhillings, that was a ſum he could not ſpare, but if half a piece would do me a courteſie I ſhould have it; I accepted it of him; and ſo of ſeveral others, ſome a Crown, ſome an Angel. but I having begun this courſe with them, they began to flight me, to ſhun my company, and to break up their accuſtomed meeting that they might avoid me; I ſeeing this; purpoſed to be gone but however, I was reſolved to try one friend more, and that was the Victualler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the man of the houſe where we met, he had been always loving and kind to me, and I had been his very good Gueſt, and many a fair pound he had taken of me, and through my means; I did not queſtion but he would lend me even what I would ask of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107141:81"/>
him; I was therefore conſidering what tall Sum I ſhould deſire of him: I remembred that when one of my Comerades bought my Watch, he not having five pounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, borrowed four pounds of our Hoſt, who gave it him at the firſt word, I was therefore reſolved to ask him for juſt ſuch a Sum; I believed my credit was better with him than the others, but I found my ſelf mightily miſtaken; <hi>The Tale was then of another Hog;</hi> for when I asked him to lend me four pounds: He cries out, How friend, four pounds! Do you know what you ſay? Do you think me mad to part from four pounds ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? I know better what to do with my Money than to lend you four pounds: Why, ſaid I, and ſtar'd on him, Is four pounds ſuch a Sum for you to lend me? you know that I have been Maſter of a greater ſum than that e're now: Yes, ſaid he, <hi>time was</hi> that you lived well at your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but that <hi>time is paſt,</hi> then indeed I ſhould not have ſcrupled to have lent you four pounds or a greater ſum, for then I knew you were in a condition to pay me, but now you are gone from thence where ſhould you get it to pay me? I tell you, in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107141:82"/>
the condition you now are, I will not lend you four Shillings, unleſs it were to march you quite off, that you may no longer come to my houſe, for I am ſenſible, that your coming hither hath driven away moſt of my Gueſts, who forbear coming to my houſe, that they may avoid your company. I know the crafty Rogue ſaid true, and did believe that it would be to no purpoſe to importune him, for I found it would be labour loſt, and that my <hi>Cake was Dough,</hi> but however reſolving not to ſtoop to ſuch a Raſcal as he, I told him it was but a <hi>Copy of my Countenance,</hi> I did but ask him to try his Conſtitution, to <hi>feel his Pulſe beat,</hi> for I knew it was convenient to try a friend before I needed him, and that I thanked my Stars, I had no need of his friendſhip yet, for I have Money enough, and thereupon drew out above five pound which I had about me, and my Watch: Nay then, ſaid he, you are a better Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band than I expected, you have made your Money hold out bravely, but take my word, if you take this courſe it will waſte, and that quickly, and ſince you have not been quite ſo bad a Prodigal as I thought you were, let me give you ſome good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:107141:82"/>Take up in time, you have rambled long enough in all conſcience, therefore leave and ſubmit to your Father and Maſter, who both wiſh you well, better than you do your ſelf: And now let me ask what you reſolve, or indeed think to do, and what courſe you intend to take? your money will be gone, and then how will you get more? If you continue in this courſe, you muſt and will fall into ſome ill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who will promiſe you fair at firſt, but will be your ruine in the end.</p>
               <p>I hearing mine Hoſt catechiſe me, could not anſwer him one ready word, but told him I knew well enough what I had to do, but I lied, I knew nomore how to diſpoſe of my ſelf than a Child of ſix years old, and indeed I have often conſidered of it ſince, that it was a great mercy that I did not fall into lewd company, for I verily believe I ſhould have hearkned to any that had asked me the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>If I had hapned among Beggars or Gypſies. I had been like enough to have made one of the <hi>Canting-Crew,</hi> and then it may be my Adventures amongſt them might have pleaſed the Reader far
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107141:83"/>
better, but I think our <hi>Engliſh Rogue</hi> hath ſufficiently deſcribed the various humours of that ſort of people; if I had met with Pick-pockets, Shop lifters, or plain High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Men, I might have ſerved with, and have learned their ſeveral Qualities, and deſcribed thoſe various Cheats to you, but they as the former, are all ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Book aforementioned. But it was my <hi>good luck</hi> to miſs of all theſe courſes, and run different ways though <hi>unfortunate</hi> enough, as you ſhall hear by and by.</p>
               <p>And now I having heard my Hoſts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and given him the anſwer I told you, I left him, being reſolved to come no more there.</p>
               <p>His diſcourſe had made me ſomewhat melancholly, and therefore I withdrawing to my Quarters, went to Bed, there I ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and conſidered with my ſelf what I ſhould do, and it was long e're I could fix upon any thing.</p>
               <p>I had my pocket pretty well furniſhed with Money, and as long as that laſted I reſolved to continue my Ramble, and not knowing whither to go, for I was no great Traveller, having never been above three
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107141:83"/>
Miles from <hi>London,</hi> except to <hi>Windſor</hi> as aforeſaid, and therefore I concluded to go thither again, and it may be as my mind ſerved to go a little further.</p>
               <p>I had been there lately before, but it was on foot, but now I intended to go Gentleman like on Horſeback. I told the Cook my Landlord of my Deſign, and he knowing I had no buſineſs there, wondered at me, but he conſidered that as I was upon the Ramble, I was never out of my way, I had told him of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe I would have him get me a Horſe, or paſs his word for one, but he not knowing my intent, and doubting that I might wander further, and it may be ſell the Horſe, and ſo leave him the Horſe to hold, to pay for a Horſe, he deſired to be excuſed; he told me that I needed not have any body paſs their words for me, ſince I had a Watch in my Pocket, which would be a very good pawn, <hi>and that never ſhames his Maſter,</hi> and if I would leave that, he would ſpeak to a friend to furniſh me with a pretty Nag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was vext to think I muſt part with my Watch, my pride, for that was my beſt Gentility, but ſuch a deſire I had to be a <hi>Cock horſe,</hi> that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107141:84"/>
and then going to his friends Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we agreed all matters thus:</p>
               <p>I gave twelve ſhillings for the uſe of the Horſe for ſix days, for ſo long I ſuppoſed to ſtay out, and left my Watch for ſecurity of the Horſe, which I ſuppoſe was worth about fifty ſhillings, ſo that what would come, the owner was ſure to loſe nothing; if I ſtaid longer than ſix days, I was to pay further two ſhillings a day. And thus was I fitted with a Horſe, and I reckoned that if I ſtaid out to ſpend all my Money, yet I had a Watch at my return would yield me more, and theſe being my thoughts and reſolves, the next day I began my journey I mounted nimbly, and rod on couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, but whether the Cook for ſome ends of his own, gave intelligence, or how it hapned I know not, but I was prevented of my journey, for alighting in a Street in <hi>London</hi> at a Milliners Shop, to buy me ſome Ribbonds for my Hat, I let my horſe ſtand at the Door, but he was ſoon ſeized on, for my Father took hold of his Bridle and gave it to my Brother, a Boy that was at hand, and ſeized me faſt by the Arm.</p>

               <p>ANd now Reader, judge you if I was not in a pitiful pickle, and if I did not think my ſelf to be in a ſad condition, the truth on't is, I expected my Father would firſt have fallen about my ears, and buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſoundly, then ſend for a Conſtable, and drag me to my Maſters, with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Boys at my heels, for I ſaw ſome ſuch kind of cattle, ſome of the young fry ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the door, and then carry me before a Juſtice, ſend me to <hi>Bridewel,</hi> all theſe things and worſe came into my head, ſo that I thought before night I ſhould be beating Hemp.

               <p>But I becauſe I could not give a good, or a wiſe Anſwer, gave none, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſilent, he proceeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Do you think you have not done well and wiſely in leaving your Maſter in this manner, can you give me any reaſon for it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hearing him proceed thus moderately, thought it would not be amiſs to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, and therefore I replyed, <hi>That I had reaſon enough to leave my Maſter, becauſe I was abuſed and wronged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid my Father, <hi>ſuppoſe you were wronged, muſt you be your own Judge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               </p>
               <p>My Father by this time had with his ſober and tender expreſſions, ſo mollified me, that I could hardly forbear <hi>putting fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in eye,</hi> which he ſeeing, and finding me flexible, again asked me <hi>if I would be ruled by him? Yes Sir,</hi> ſaid I: <hi>Well then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you ſhall go home with me, and I will take a time to go to your Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hearing that I might go to his houſe and not to my Maſters, was well enough contented, and ſo my Father and I walked homewards, and my Brother by my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers directions went with the Horſe from whence he came, ſo that I did verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Cook my Landlord had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied me.</p>
               <p>I went home with my Father, where I had not much ſaid to terrifie or affright me: My Mother in law telling me that ſhe was glad to ſee me, and all was as fair and ſmooth as could be.</p>
               <p>I having eaten and drunk with them at convenient times, went to Bed; it was
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107141:86"/>
then when I was alone that I had time to conſider what condition I was in, and the conſideration of it very much troubled me, But however my Father being ſo fair, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to leave all to his diſcreet manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I have ſeveral times ſince conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great fear I was in all the time of my Ramble, of meeting with my Maſter or Father; no deep indebted and almoſt bankrupt Citizen, could be in greater fear of a Serjeant or Bailiff, I went no where if in the day time, but I had my eyes every way, I looked fore-right and on each ſide me, and oftentimes behind me, if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon bruſhed by me my heart was preſently at my Mouth, thinking that it was one of them that came to ſeize me, if I heard any making haſte after me, I mended my pace, and looked back ready to run faſter, I was full of fears dreading every one I met; by this I know that as the contemplation and thoughts of a happineſs or good, is more than the thing it ſelf when enjoyed, ſo the fear and cares that attends the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a danger, is more than falling into the danger it ſelf; for as I have fancied the great pleaſure and happineſs I ſhould have and enjoy, if I could but have ſuch a

deſire of mine fulfilled, and when it hath hapned as I wiſhed, when I have enjoyed what I ſo earneſtly deſired, I then found no ſuch great pleaſure or content in it, the fruition was not half ſo pleaſant as the contemplation; ſo I have again thought that if I ſhould be ſo unfortunate as to be thruſt into a Priſon how miſerable I ſhould be, and that having fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My Maſter knowing that it would be almoſt impoſſible to regulate things as he ought between his Son and I, he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willing to be rid of me, he knew that it was unreaſonable, that his Son coming three years after me, ſhould take place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and continue, ſo all the time, and that by that means I ſhould be under Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice all the time, he I was reſolved it ſhould be ſo, but he knew that I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admit of this, and he knew that my Father would endeavour to remedy it, and this would make continual brauls in his Houſe.</p>
               <p>He alſo knew well enough, that if I were gone, he could not want for more Apprentices when he pleaſed, and he could have conſiderable ſums of money with them, and therefore he was not at all diſpleaſed with my departure.</p>
               <p>And let me tell you, that I have obſerved and known that ſome Citizens have much encreaſed their Eſtates by taking many
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107141:87"/>
Apprentices, for perhaps having fifty pounds or more with an Apprentice, and being very ſevere and rigid, the boy hath been ſo hardly uſed, that he hath run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way within a year, and rather than return again loſe all his Money. I knew one that ſerved eight ſo one after another, and in three or four years, by this means gained four hundred pounds for their diet, which they likewiſe earned, cauſing them to work like Porters, ſo that I think they paid dear enough for it, they had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have been boarded at the coſtlieſt Boarding-ſchool in <hi>England;</hi> and beſides the loſs of the Money, there was a worſe inconvenience, for the Apprentice hath been quite ſpoiled, ſo haraſſed and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he hath not been fit for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervice, and for the ſake of his firſt Maſter, would not be perſwaded to go to any other, a ſecond: And beſides this, it may be an After-clap hath hapned to the poor Apprentice or his friends, worſe than all the reſt; for Bond being given for truth, and true ſervice, that hath alſo been ſued, and much Money recovered that way, and then trouble and charge hath faln up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe friends that entertained this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107141:88"/>
till agreement hath been made, for the Law gives the Maſter five pounds a night againſt any that ſhall entertain him.</p>
               <p>By this means ſome Citizens have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their Eſtates, but whoever they are that make this their practice, let me tell them, That it is a very wicked one, it is worſe than Robbery, nay, than any kind of miſchief that I know of, for it is not onely a perfect Cheat, or Robbery of ſo much Money, but it is the undoing of a young man that might with good uſage have made a good Commonwealths-man, be of good uſe to God and his Prince in doing them Service, but are by this means ſpoiled: And therefore let ſuch Maſters look to it, for although their Money may thrive at preſent, yet it will conſume all the reſt in time, and be as bad to them as worſe gotten Goods or Eſtate, that is rarely poſſeſſed to the third generation. They ought to conſider that when they take an Apprentice, they take as great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

good or bad into him, that is the time of his making or marring, and what is well grounded in him and he learns then, he will never forget; therefore the greateſt care of Parents ought to be in the choice of a good Maſter; you may ſoon diſcover ſuch a one as will uſe you as I have related by enquiry, whether he hath ever made free any Apprentices that have ſerved their times out with him, and if ſo, do but enquire of them, and you may gheſs at the temper of the Maſter; but ſome Parents think that if the Maſter they intend to place their Sons with be but a rich man, and hath a great Trade, that all is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but let me tell them, that it is not enough, ſeveral other things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and there hath been one thing that hath made much difference between Maſters and Servants, and that hath been difference in opinion and judgment, for I do not think it fit for a Boy that hath been bred up in the Orthodoxal way, ſhould be Apprentice with an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> or <hi>Quaker;</hi> this very thing does oftentimes cauſe much jarring betwixt Man and Wife, as well as Maſter and Apprentice; but this Scruple or Caution is now adays almoſt

make his advantage out of it, for the more unwilling my Maſter was to receive me, the more forward my Father was to preſs him to take me, ſo that if he ſhould whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſe it, he might get good part of his Money again.</p>
               <p>Theſe were my Fathers ends, and he mannaged them with all circumſpection and prudence accordingly.</p>
               <p>He went firſt to my Maſters, and told him that he had found his Servant, asking what he intended to do with me? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, he cared not what, for he would not entertain me; but ſome body muſt, ſaid my Father; let who will ſaid my Maſter, I care not; well then, replied my Father, I ſhall have your leave to do it if I will. Yes, yes, ſaid my Maſter: This was as my Father wiſhed, and the danger of that was over, and then he proceeded further, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to receive me: My Maſter refuſed it, and ſaid he believed that I durſt not come to him: Yes but he ſhall, ſaid my Father, and ſerve you out the reſt of his time if you will do him juſtice, and let him enjoy his right; I will not be appointed what to do with my Servants, ſaid my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: But to conclude, after many diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107141:90"/>
the end of all was this: I was brought to my Maſter to tell him that I would, if he pleaſed, ſerve out my time with him: I had much ado to be perſwaded, to ſay theſe words, but my Father telling me his intent by them, and what would follow, I ſaid ſo, and it fell out as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; for my Father well enough know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if I would come to him again, he could not refuſe me, and he being willing to be rid of me, anſwered directly that he was not willing to receive me, and if he was compelled to it, I ſhould ſuffer for it, and that the Chamberlain would order me firſt to be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>My Father replied, not for his firſt fault, and he having ſome reaſon for it, as I ſhall tell him.</p>
               <p>I was pleaſed with this, and ſo was not my Maſter, who had ſaid all he could to frighten me; but I ſeeing my Father ſtood up ſo ſtifly for me, did not fear any thing, and my Father by this means wrought his ends, for my Maſter telling me I muſt look another Maſter; my Father replied, ſo he ſhall if you will put him in as good caſe as you found him, and thereupon complained of my Cloaths, and demanded

Money back to give with me to another Maſter, they argued <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> but in the end agreed, and my Maſter repaid ten pounds, if not fifteen of the money he had received with me, and ſo we parted.</p>
               <p>I have been very particular in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and it may be you will think it te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, but I hope it may be for the future good of the Reader, who may either as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Apprentice, or Maſter, be in the ſame condition, and pick ſomewhat out of this my relation that may advantage them; that is the chief end of my writing it, and that my Misfortunes and Miſery may conduce to the good fortune and happineſs of others. This affair was prudently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by my Father, who had he been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere at his firſt lighting on me, I had been ruined to eternity, for I ſhould have run away again if he had forced me to go to my Maſter. This my Father judged would be the caſe, and therefore prevented it, but he did uſe all the arguments he could raiſe to induce me to ſubmit to my Maſter and ſerve my time, and when that would do no good, he fell to threatnings, charging me on his bleſſing to obey him, but I was deaf to his threatnings, and my diſobedience hath ſince that ſame time wrought very
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107141:91"/>
much upon my ſpirit, and made ſo deep an impreſſion thereon, that I doubt it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wear out, for although it is above twenty years ago, yet I am to this day troubled at it both day and night, and my very dreams are filled with that concern, oftentimes imagining that I am ſtill Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to my ſaid Maſter, and that my time will never be out, ſo that becauſe I did not ſerve him in effect, I ſtill ſerve him in fancy and imagination.</p>
               <p>And this my diſobedience to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I judge to be the cauſe of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Misfortunes that have ſince faln upon me, and therefore I can do no leſs than make open confeſſion thereof, no other ſatisfaction can I give him, he being now dead.</p>
               <p>He did I hope forgive me when living, for I was ſeveral times after that recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him, but he would ſtill tell me my diſobedience would be my ruine, and that I did not underſtand the love he had for me.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs that I did not look upon him to love me no longer than he was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to me, and when he held his hand, I thought he forgot his duty, and that I might remit mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:107141:91"/>But I ſince find this ſaying of his to be moſt true.</p>

               <p>I have ſince had the experience of his ſaying, and have repented of my ſlighting him; all that I can ſay more is now to God and the World, and that I here make my Confeſſion, and that with Contrition, not doubting but that I ſhall have Remiſſion and Abſolution in this world and in the world to come, and hope that after all my Affliction, I may yet have ſome comfort and peaceable enjoyment of my ſelf in this life, and I have ſome cauſe to expect a future quiet Conſolation, becauſe I hope the meaſure of my Misfortunes and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (all which I judge are faln upon me for my diſobedience and other crimes) is now full enough, and that I have already received afflictions enough, but if it be not ſo, and that it is not yet enough, yet I hope, at the worſt, that all my puniſhment will fall on me in this life, which I beſeech God to grant, ſo that in the next I may enjoy the quiet and content that I have
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107141:92"/>
hitherto wanted, and which all true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite repentant ſinners hope to enjoy; but I have this reaſon to believe that I ſhall be acquitted from the ill ſervice I did my Maſter, if Retaliation be a due puniſhment for a Crime, for all the ill ſervice I ever did him, hath been retaliated to me in the bad ſervice of my Servants, for I have had as bad as bad could be, as I ſhall acquaint you more particularly when I arrive at that place of my ſtory, and that I may come to it, I will thus proceed:</p>
               <p>My Father recived back either ten or fifteen of his thirty pounds given with me, and as bad a Servant as I was to my Maſter, yet he alſo freely gave up to my Father the hundred pound Bond he had given him for my truth, ſo that I was not in the leaſt tainted in my Reputation that ways. All that I remember was ever laid to my charge or objected againſt me, was the private Copying of thoſe Writings I have told you of; and another time I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent to receive two hundred pounds, and not being ſo well skilled in telling Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as I ought, I finding that he that told it to me was as quick again as I, made haſte too, that I might not be accounted dull,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107141:92"/>
and thereby loſt about five ſhillings, but it being the firſt time I did ſo, my Maſter did pardon me, but withal telling me, that if I did ſo again, either I or my Father ſhould pay for it. But I from that time became more curious, and learned ſo much skill as I ſeldome loſt but often gained thereby, as once for Example.</p>
               <p>A great Boobily fellow, much older than my ſelf, came to receive eight pounds of me, it being all in half Crowns I quickly told it off with both hands; the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeeing me ſo nimble, and being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his own ignorance, for he hardly knew how to tell forty ſhillings; he alſo told the Money with both his hands, and tumbled it over in a confuſed manner: I obſerving that, was reſolved to put a trick on him and try his skill, wherefore I twice together told to him but four pounds in ſtead of five; it was all as one to him, he ſtill ſaid it was right, and having tumbled it all over, he gave me the Receipt, and away he went contented: I laid by the forty ſhillings, not with intent to get ſo much by him, no, I thought that to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, I did not intend he ſhould pay ſo dear for his ignorance and folly; I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107141:93"/>
and deſigned to have a pair of Gloves or ſome Treat, and therefore told one of it that knew him, we had ſome laughing, and he upon asking him ſome queſtions about the parcel of Money, found that he wanted ſome, but withal he was aſhamed to acknowledge how the Miſtake was, but his friend ſeeing his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and willfulneſs, helped him out, and told him all the ſtory, and the other agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give me a pair of Gloves, and he and I, a quart of Wine, I gave him the forty ſhillings, adviſing him to learn to tell Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney better.</p>
               <p>I being now clearly diſcharged from my Maſter, followed my Father home, where he again thus renewed his diſcourſe to me:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, now you are free from your Maſter, I ſuppoſe you are glad of it, you think you have made a good days work of it, and I am not of your mind, for I believe it to be the worſt days work you ever made in your life, and that you will have time enough to repent it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I gave him the hearing of all this, not anſwering one word, and indeed, I knew not what to ſay nor to do; I was not well enough skill'd in my trade to think of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107141:93"/>
up and be a Maſter my ſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt reſolve to have another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>My Father adviſed me to ſeek out for another, as he would do, but I loſt my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, none would take me, knowing that I had ſo fooliſhly left my Maſter, they could not be perſwaded that the fault was in him and therefore all Maſters of any account refuſed me, none but ſome idle young fellows would take me, and with ſuch a one at length I was placed.</p>
               <p>But before I go to any other Maſter, and come into a new houſe and family, I muſt give a ſtop, and relate ſome paſſages in my fathers.</p>
               <p>I have already told you that I had a Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, and now I ſhall give you her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
               <p>She was to the outſide of as promiſing a good nature as could be, ſhe had a very ſmooth ſmiling countenance, and always laugh'd or ſneer'd when ſhe talked with me, ſhe was a good Huſwife in her houſe, and appeared to be a good Wife to a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and to me ſhe ſeemed to be a very kind Mother-in-law, but I was miſtaken, I thought I had God Almighty by the

Hand, when as I had the Devil by the great Toc; ſhe was a right <hi>Yorker,</hi> being of that Countrey breed, and as full of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation and hipocriſy as moſt of that Countrey.</p>
               <p>This Woman had been three times mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to three ſeveral Citizens; her two firſt Husbands had little good luck with her all their lives time, and at laſt had ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deaths.</p>
               <p>The firſt was kill'd in a Tavern with a quart pot which an angry friend threw at him; this Husband had been ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that he died worſe than nothing in Eſtate, for he owed more than he was worth: She cauſed one friend of hers to pretend a Debt, which ſhe as Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix pretended to pay to him, who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to her again, and ſo deceived all her Husbands Creditors, and to make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addition to her Eſtate, ſhe having thus gained all her Husbands Stock, he that killed her Husband, agreed to renew the Leaſe of her houſe to her by paying a Fine, if ſhe would acquit him of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death: This was agreed upon, and accordingly performed.</p>
               <p>Thus was the loſs of her Husband a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107141:94"/>
gain to her: She had now a Houſe and Stock of her own free of all debts and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, onely ſhe had one Child, a Daughter, by him. Being in this condition, ſhe was wooed by, and wedded to another Citizen of honeſt condition and quality, who alſo had by her ſeveral Children, two which were Daughters did out live him: He had three Sons of his own by a former Wife, whom he bred up and placed out, who alſo out-lived him: But although he died in a good Eſtate, yet his Sons were little the better for it.</p>
               <p>This Citizen dealing much in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and keeping Fairs, in his return from one, died ſuddenly at an Inn on the Road. Small care was taken by her for his burial although ſhe knew of his death, but ſhe had other matters in hand of greater moment, <hi>ſhe had other fiſh to fry,</hi> and ſo ſhe left his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to be managed by a Servant.</p>
               <p>The eldeſt of his Sons being of Age, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires into his Fathers Eſtate, expecting a large portion, he being the eldeſt Son and Heir apparent to it, but he reckoned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Hoſt, and therefore muſt reckon twice, his Mother-in-law had ſuch Cards to ſhew as would beat him out of play.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107141:95"/>
She produced a Will, but ſuch a one as was onely to prejudice her Husbands ſons, and made up wholly the Intereſt of herſelf and two Daughters.</p>
               <p>This Will was made in one ſheet of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in a blind manner, written by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the Houſe, and onely witneſſed by him, who was known to be her great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, who was employed by her to go down and ſee her Husband buried, and be ſure to bring up the Seal-Ring, with which the Will was ſealed, and ſo he being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Will was produced, and in it after a few ceremonial words, were theſe or to this effect:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I give and bequeath to my living Wife all theſe my two Tenements, ſituate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the term of her natural life, and after her deceaſe, I give them to my two Daughters and their Heirs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe and hers were provided for, but not one word of his Sons in all the Will.</p>
               <p>The Son ſeeing this, demands an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the perſonal Eſtate, but a ſmall matter comes to his ſhare, ſhe ſweeps away two thirds of it, one as her due by the Cuſtome of the City, and another as her
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107141:95"/>
due in regard her Husband had not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe given or diſpoſed of it by Will.</p>
               <p>And now let me tell the Reader by way of Caution, what it may be he is not as yet acquainted withal, That a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> if he hath a Wife and Children, can give away but one third part of his perſonal Eſtate: One third part his Wife will have, another third part his Children will have, and the other third he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of as he pleaſes, either to Wife or Children, or Strangers, as he thinks fit. If he dies without a Will, or ſuch a one as does not diſpoſe of his third, then it goes to his Wife as ſhe is Adminiſtratrix, and this was the Caſe of this Citizen, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he died poſſeſſed of an Eſtate of Free-hold, worth five or ſix hundred pounds, and ſix hundred pounds perſonal Eſtate, yet a ſmall matter came to his Sons, for the Free-hold is gone as I told you, and the perſonal Eſtate conſiſting of ſix hundred pounds, being to be divided, ſhe hath four hundred pounds for her two thirds, and then two hundred pounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be divided amongſt five, his three Sons, and her two Daughters, (for they came in for a ſhare equal with the reſt)
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107141:96"/>
the Sons have juſt forty pounds a piece, and this is all they were like to have of the Eſtate.</p>
               <p>The eldeſt Son being told that he had foul play ſhew'd him, and believing it, he flutter'd and went to Law to overthrow the Will, but to no purpoſe; ſhe had the better Purſe, and ſuch a Witneſs on her ſide as did not flinch from her, ſo that all the young mans endeavours were in vain, he onely made himſelf worſe, by ſpending his Money, and at laſt was forced to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, though he was not contented, for in ſhort time after, diſcontent broke his heart.</p>
               <p>This and all the former paſſages have been related to me, and I am apt to believe the truth of them all, becauſe I have found the whole ſtate and buſineſs to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſo wicked purpoſes; for although ſhe enjoyed all during her life, yet ſince that, their Children are dead, except one, the moſt inconſiderable of all, and nothing is left of them, no not remembrance; his Children did live and arrive to very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Eſtates, but are all ſince dead, and their Eſtates gone, and now her Eſtate is in the hands of ſtrangers, and that Servant who
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107141:96"/>
was her Confident, did never thrive in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Eſtate, dying long ſince in want and poverty.</p>
               <p>This was the Woman that was my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in law, and ſhe was likely enough to be too cunning for me, having paſſed through theſe Projects with ſo much ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>My Father had married her upon ſmall acquaintance, and knew none of her Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he had not enquired, and therefore knowing nothing believed all to be aright; ſhe had a conſiderable Eſtate, and that was as much as he aimed at, that being the chief care of moſt thriving Citizens to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into that, and afterwards to deal with them as cunningly as they can.</p>
               <p>I being come home to my Fathers, my Mother-in law made very fair weather to me, and gave me many good words, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, That ſhe had already, and would again ſpeak to my Father in my behalf, and to pleaſe me the better, ſhe was propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Match for me with one of her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhe having three, would talk of match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to me and my two Brothers (for that was our ſtock, there being no Siſters) All theſe kind of pleaſing Diſcourſes
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107141:97"/>
ſhe would have in my Fathers abſence, and before his and my face, ſhe would incline ſomewhat to my ſide, and take my part; by this I ſuppoſed ſhe was my real friend, but I found it otherwiſe, as I ſhall preſently, tell you:</p>
               <p>I lying in the Garret over the Chamber where my Father and ſhe lay, and one night hearing them in ſome earneſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſuppoſing it might concern me, and therefore being deſirous to underſtand what was ſaid, I aroſe, and went down Stairs to their Chamber door, and laying my ear thereto, I could hear her tongue ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In good truth now Husband, if you humour your Son in this manner, you will undo him and your ſelf too, for if he find that he can thus rule you, he will ſtay with no Maſter you can put him to, nay, and he will run out and make you pay for it, he will weary you; Is it not far better to pack him away to Sea? for he will never do well with any Maſter here, do you think that he will ſerve out his time with any Maſter that would not ſtay where he was ſo well uſed? Let him to Sea I ſay,</q> 
                  <hi>the Sea and the Gallows refuſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107141:97"/>
none;</hi> 
                  <q>let him bite on the Bridle he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it: If my other Husband had not been ruled by me in the diſpoſing and ordering of his Son, he would have deſtroied his Eſtate and broke his heart too, but he took my counſel, and ſent him to Sea, and then when he came back, he was content with any thing: You have been (continued ſhe) at the charge to put him to Apprentice, and gave a good portion with him, that is loſt, and now he is ready for another, for who will take him without Money, and he will ſtay at another place as many nights as days, and then you will be to ſeek again, and be continually troubled with him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>My Father had lain ſtill and given her the full hearing of all ſhe had uttered, and ſo had I too, but not without curſing her for a <hi>diſſembling hypocritical Gypſie,</hi> but ſhe having done, my Father then made this reply:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But Lamb, you miſtake the matter quite, things are not ſo bad as you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, nor my Son, as I hope, ſo bad as you think him; he was a little wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his Maſters, though he ought not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107141:98"/>
for that cauſe to have left his ſervice, but his Maſter gain'd little by the Bargain, for he hath paid back good part of the Money he had with him, and that will be ſufficient to place him any where elſe, I do not intend to be at any freſh charge with him. I ſhall not need it, and I think I know of a Maſter that will be willing to take him on even terms, without any Money, and then I ſhall gain and not loſe by the bargain.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It will be well if you do (replied ſhe) but I ſhould like it better if you would ſend him to Sea.</q> When you are hang'd thought I, and ſo attending a while longer, and hearing them ſilent, I though I had heard enough, and therefore returned to my Bed.</p>
               <p>The next morning I looked this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the face to ſee if ſhe ſtill continued her pleaſant countenance to me, but I found no alteration, ſhe ſtill fleir'd on me, and my Father being gone out, ſhe cauſed me to fit down by her very lovingly to Breakfaſt, uſing the kindeſt and lovingeſt expreſſions that could be poſſibly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh</hi> (thought I) <hi>this Woman is a Devil!</hi> I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107141:98"/>
muſt not truſt her, I will be gone on any terms, and ſo I was, for my Father that day diſcourſing with one that was willing to take me, I went with him and a agreed on the matter, and ſo the next day took my leave of my Mother-in-law, and went ſoon after to my new Maſters.</p>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107141:99"/>
mended the matter well, by coming out of <hi>Gods bleſſing into the warm Sun;</hi> for my preſent Maſter was ſuch a one as I can hardly deſcribe; I cannot ſay if my other Maſter was bad, this was worſe; no, my former Maſter could not be termed bad in compariſon of this, but if I may at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, I cannot more fitly than by ſaying that my ſecond Maſter was juſt quite contrary to what my firſt was, for to begin:</p>
               <p>If my firſt Maſter was (as indeed he was) <hi>a ſober ſolid Citizen,</hi> this ſecond was quite contrary, being a <hi>looſe debauch'd Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fain:</hi> If my firſt Maſter was <hi>well known</hi> in his Trade or Practice (as I muſt ſtill grant in all) this was as <hi>ignorant,</hi> knowing little or nothing: If my firſt Maſter had a <hi>full Trade and large Practice,</hi> this as not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, had <hi>nothing to do:</hi> If my firſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was uſed to ſtay ſtill at home in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and do his buſineſs there, and if ſent for to a Tavern or publique houſe, to ſend word he was at home, and was there rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do their buſineſs; this my ſecond Maſter was the quite contrary, being rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at home, and if at home when ſent for to the Tavern, he deſired no better place
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107141:100"/>
to do buſineſs in, but ſent word he would wait on them preſently, and would be ſure to be as good as his word.</p>
               <p>As I do not remember that in all the time I lived with my firſt Maſter, I knew him to go three times to the Tavern; ſo I do not remember that in all the time that I lived with my ſecond Maſter, that he was out of the Tavern or Alehouſe for three, nay two days together.</p>
               <p>It was as common for me to ſeek out, and wait on him every night from a tavern, as it was for me to wait on my firſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter every Sunday to and from Church. The credit of the one was not ſo good, but the other was as bad; the one was <hi>honeſt,</hi> the other a <hi>Knave;</hi> for I never knew or heard that the one was ever queſtioned for any unjuſt Action, when as I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the other, my laſt Maſter, was not onely queſtioned, but did alſo ſtand in the Pillory for cheating a Carrier: To ſay all, the one was in every thing quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the other was, the one was old, and the other young; the one rich (as he deſerved) and the other poor, as it was but juſtice he ſhould be. I muſt confeſs there was ſome difference in the women
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107141:100"/>
too, but it was on the advantage to my laſt Miſtreſs, for my firſt was ſomewhat anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and to me froward and ill natur'd, when as my ſecond Miſtreſs was a brave young handſome, ſprightly, beautiful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and as well repleniſhed with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beauties and perfections of the mind, as ſhe was graced with theſe of the body. But ſhe having ſo untoward a piece to her Husband, was undone by him, and lived poor and unhealthily, wanting and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and ſo good virtuous woman ſhe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently died. When as I think the other ſtill lives in all poſſible content, health, wealth, and plenty; I have no cauſe to touch upon either of their Chaſtities, for I verily believe that in that point, they were both alike, and I am confident both very virtuous.</p>
               <p>This is the beſt Character I can give of my new Maſter, ſo that I may truly ſay, <hi>I leap'd out of the Frying-pan into the fire;</hi> nay, it is improper for me to ſay ſo, for the Fiſh that leaps out of the Frying-pan where he is to be ſcalded and dye, in ſhort time by leaping out of it into the fire, is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burnt, and ſo is ſaid that he does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by leap out of a bad condition into a worſe,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107141:101"/>
this I cannot properly ſay of my ſelf, when I was with my firſt Maſter I was not in the Frying-pan, I was not in danger of ſcalding and dying, I was in no fear of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, but I was comparatively as well and as ſafe there as a Fiſh in a Pond or River, ſo that I may ſay, in leaving him for the other, I leapt out of the Water into the Fire, the place where I was well, and where I ought to be, into that which would abſolutely be my ruine if I ſhould remain with him my full time, and follow his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Example. But I took courſe my ſelf in the one, becauſe I continued not with him above a year, and I thank God he gave me more Grace than to put his Examples in practice.</p>
               <p>I have told you that I continued about a year with this my ſecond Maſter, I would not have you think me to be ſo idle as to loſe my time and do nothing, it may be in what I did I gained nothing, but however it is good to be always in action.</p>
               <p>My Maſter had little or no employment for me, he himſelf riſing between ſeven and eleven uſually went abroad, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly about the ſame hours at night he
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107141:101"/>
returned; he being thus commonly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and being deſirous at leaſt to be ſo good a Husband as to have ſomebody in his Shop to anſwer people, took me for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>My firſt buſineſs was to write blank Bonds and other Blanks of all ſorts, and having ſeldome any occaſion to uſe them, I had ſoon furniſhed the Shop with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as were likely at that rate to ſerve for many a year, I had now and then ſome odd blind Letters to write, and once in a week or fortnight, a Bond or ſome ſuch ſmall Jobb to do, a pair of Leaſes or any ſuch kind of Writings came ſeldome, not oftner than once in a quarter of a year or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>My Father to encourage both me and my Maſter, did bring us ſome buſineſs, but all this did but little as to a full employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for me, ſo that now I had time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to converſe with <hi>Knights Errant,</hi> in reading their Adventures. I had ſtill kept my Books, and by my daily additions lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out all the Money I could ſpare, I had ſwelled them to ſuch a number, that they looked like a Library, and my Maſter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me ſo to diſpoſe them in his little
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107141:102"/>
Shop, that they were the beſt furniture therein.</p>
               <p>They that came into our Shop, might by the outſide of the Books, imagine that we were well furniſhed with Law Books according to our practice, but if they had ſearched their inſide, they would have found their miſtake, when in ſtead of the <hi>Statutes at large,</hi> and <hi>Cooks Reports,</hi> they ſhould ſee <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Orlando Furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſo,</hi> and in ſtead of <hi>Brooks Abridgment,</hi> and ſome ſuch old Law Books, they would have found the <hi>Mirrour of Knighthood,</hi> they would have been much miſtaken when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Gown-men pleading at the Bar, they found Sword-men fighting at the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers. I had read theſe Books ſo often both in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> that I was very well experienc'd in that Language, and being deſirous to appear in the World like ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, did reſolve to do the ſame kindneſs to others as had been done for me, and as I thought would be of publick good: I did not think it fit that ſince I had a Talent, to lay it up in a Napkin, but to put it to the beſt uſe I could; and beſides theſe, I had ſeveral other reaſons to induce me to it, as the great profit I ſhould gain by it, and alſo
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107141:102"/>
the glory and fame I ſhould purchaſe by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Print, this was ſuch a deſire as I could not moderate nor allay; therefore I was reſolv'd to begin, neither was I long in ſtudying what Book to tranſlate, but believing all the world to be of my mind, Lovers of <hi>Knight Errantry,</hi> I pitch'd upon <hi>Amadis de Gaul;</hi> the firſt five Parts being already tranſlated, and the world wanting the ſixth, I intended to make them behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me for it.</p>
               <p>I thereupon began this Adventure, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther luckily or no you ſhall know by and by, and ſuch impatience had I to ſee it in Print, that before I had near done one quarter, I ſought out how to get it print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I treated with ſeveral Bookſellers of my acquaintance, but they either deſiring me to finiſh it firſt, or not coming to my terms, (I having not the patience to finiſh it) was reſolved to print it at my own charges. I did not as they that go to build or to war ought to do, lay by for it, for I am ſure I did neither lay by nor provide for it; but I had ſo great a deſire to have it done, that I was reſolv'd to ſee it begun; and therefore meeting with ſome that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded and encouraged me, and an honeſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107141:103"/>
Widow-woman to be my Printer, I began: She expected me to ſend in all or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Paper, but my Money nor Credit would not reach to any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I made a ſhift to ſcramble up ſo much Money together as did purchaſe ſix Reams of Paper (when as ſixty would not finiſh it) and that I ſent in with a promiſe that the reſt ſhould ſuddenly follow; ſhe either believing me, or elſe I believe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little elſe to do, did put a man upon it, but never did <hi>Green-ſickneſs'd Girl</hi> long with half ſo much earneſtneſs for <hi>Chalk</hi> or <hi>Oatmeal,</hi> as I did to ſee a ſheet of this done, that I might carry it in my Pocket, and ſhew to ſome of my Comerades what a famous fellow I was like to be.</p>
               <p>The time did come, and I ſaw my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires accompliſhed; but before that, I had a large conteſt with my ſelf about what number of them ſhould be printed, I was not ſo great a fool as one that being to print a Book, and being as unreſolved what number to do as I was, did after much time ſpent and various conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reſolve to print twice as many as there were Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> his reaſon being this, that although all the people

of every pariſh would not buy of them, he cauſe all could not read, yet the Prieſt and the Clerk could read, and therefore they he thought would buy.</p>
               <p>No, I was not ſo errant a <hi>Coxcomb</hi> as he, but I went another way to work, I knew not how many people would buy of them, but I knew ſome Bookſellers would, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome with whom I dealt had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to take a dozen or a quarter of a hundred or more apiece.</p>
               <p>I did therefore believe that every Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller would, nay, muſt buy of them, and therefore I took the pains to walk from <hi>Aldgate</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and reckon up how many Bookſellers there was there, and in all other places about the Town. I was well ſet at work the while, and after this way of calculation I had reckoned how many to print; But after all this extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant pains, I was forced to go back to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther number, and be ruled by my Printer to print the ordinary Impreſſion of one thouſand.</p>
               <p>This being agreed upon, and the Preſs going forward, and I proceeding in my tranſlation, we quickly had a ſtop for want of Paper, I knew not what courſes to take,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107141:104"/>
but as the moſt feiſable I could imagine, I carried a ſheet of a ſort of what was done to ſome Bookſellers of my acquaintance, and deſired them to encourage and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſo good a Work, by depoſiting or lending ſome money to help to finiſh it, and that when it was done, they ſhould pay themſelves by Books: They would not hear of that ſide, they would not buy Books before they were finiſhed, but if I would ſell them Books which they knew I had, they would give me Money: I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other way was forced to take that courſe, but withal, I made this propoſition That I might have my Books again when I returned the Money with ſome ſmall gain; they promiſed me fair, but perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing, for afterwards when I came to redeem my Books, they told me that they were ſold, but if I had a mind, and would give ſuch a price, they would endeavor to get them again: Some I had, and ſome I loſt, but by this means I broke and ſpoyl'd my Library, however by the ſale of theſe Books and ſome little credit I had with the Stationer, my Book was finiſhed. Never did <hi>young Big-belly'd Woman</hi> deſire to ſee the Fruit and Iſſue of her Body, as I did to

and Authors) coyned ſeveral new <hi>Engliſh</hi> Words, which were onely ſuch <hi>French</hi> Words as methoughts had a fine Tone wieh them, or ſuch as I could not handfomely rranſlate, and therefore let them paſs as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to be underſtood as well by the Reader, as by me the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who knew not what to make of them.</p>

               <p>I was again ttoubled about Paper, but I had ſome Money, my Stationer ſome Faith, and the Book was much leſs than the former, ſo that finiſhed it was, and I ſuppoſing this Book to be more gentile than the former, gave it a more gentile Title, and the Name of the Tranſlator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plac'd on the Title-page in large Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, there was alſo added the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Word <hi>Gent.</hi> to import that the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator was a Gentleman, that he was every Inch of him in his own imagination, and did believe that the ſo printing that word on the Title of the Book, did as much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title

               <p>My Maſter was as good a Husband of his time as I have told you, and moſt of my time was ſpent in my own Affairs, either in writing or reading for my own pleaſure or walk abroad to viſit the Printers; my Maſter knew of my deſigns, and ſince he had little for me to do, permitted me to proceed and imploy my ſelf that way, but

I had gotten a haunt of rambling and could not leave it, and therefore ſhe complained to my Maſter of me; he chid me, but I minded it not, and continuing ſo ſtill, he complained to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and great fault was found with me, ſo that I was weary of his and my Fathers Reprehenſions. I ſaw there was nothing gained by being there, and therefore was deſirous to be gone: I had compar'd notes with ſome of the neighbouring Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, and one or two having as giddy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled minds as my ſelf, we were reſolved to travel.</p>
               <p>Now we being all indifferently skill'd in <hi>French,</hi> were deſirous to ſee <hi>France:</hi> This Deſign was long conſulted on, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by me in few days to be put in execution, when an accident hapned between me and my Maſter that haſtened it.</p>
               <p>Although we had but little buſineſs to do in the Shop, yet my Maſter pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had a very conſiderable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and ſeveral people came to our Shop
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107141:107"/>
as well as to other Scriveners, to borrow Money upon Security.</p>
               <p>I had command from my Maſter to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them all, and promiſe to do their buſineſs, and ſome waiting their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſpake with my Maſter in a Morning (for afterwards it was rare to meet with him) he giving them many fair promiſes, they ſometimes treated him at the Ale-houſe or Tavern, but to little purpoſe; for I hardly remember any thing came to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection but that they being in time wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out with attendance, at length left him.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the reſt that frequented our Shop upon the borrowing Account, there was one Gentleman that had often ſpoken with my Maſter, received fair promiſes and many delaies, he being very earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have his buſineſs diſpatch'd, not onely treated my Maſter at Ale-houſe and Taverns, but me alſo, deſiring my aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and remembrance to my Maſter: I promiſed him my utmoſt Service, though I did believe all would turn to little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for him.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman came ſo often, and had ſo many <hi>put-offs</hi> from my Maſter, that I
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107141:107"/>
wondred, he being very ingenious, did not underſtand rhem to be <hi>flams,</hi> but he ſtill had the patience to come, and that ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that I was aſham'd, and pitied him, and but that I knew I ſhould diſpleaſe him would have told him how matters were, that he might forbear coming: I gave him ſeveral Hints, but he did not, or would not underſtand them, for when he did ask me When I thought his buſineſs would be done? I would tell him that <hi>thought was free,</hi> and I ſhould not tell him what I thought, but that my Maſter ſtill ſaid it ſhould be ſuddenly, he being very deſirous of perfecting his buſineſs imagined (as he wiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:107141:108"/>This was a very authentick and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Anſwer, and for ſuch a one it paſſed currantly, but I knowing what company he had been in at the night he named, did give preſent Judgment that this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans buſineſs was very unlikely to be done, and that he muſt be fool'd. He came ſtill, and one day having treated me at the Ale-houſe, where he very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſcourſed of Books, eſpecially <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry</hi> and <hi>Romances,</hi> and thereby pleaſed me exceedingly, and then again asking me what I thought of his buſineſs? I could no longer forbear but out it muſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I told him in plain terms, That I thought his buſineſs would never be done, he was mighty blank at that which he ſaid, and asked twenty queſtions at once, but above all, asked me if I were not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with my Maſter one evening with the man that was to lend the Money? I was (replied I) with my Maſter and ſome other company that evening, but I do not think that any that were there preſent had any Money to lend, but that they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Borrowers than Lenders, and that I ſuppoſed they would ſooner take a Purſe upon the High-way, than part from any to a <hi>Scrivener</hi> to lend.</p>

               <p>I know not what they were, ſaid I, but you may judge if they were Money-len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders wen I ſhall tell you that I that Evening by my Miſtreſs command did go to find my Maſter, that after my uſual ſearch of moſt Taverns in my way, and which I knew he haunted, I found him at one in <hi>Southwark,</hi> I was not admitted into the Room where he was at preſent, becauſe he and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were engaged in hot ſervice, which they plied ſo hard, that after a while there was a great ſilence,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Drawer hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, went in and found all the company aſleep, but at his <hi>Do you call Gentlemen?</hi> my Maſter awaked, and asked what a Clock it was? The Drawer ſaid it was late, and withal told him that his Man was there, Bring in another Bottle of Wine, ſaid he, and ſend him in, with that the Drawer went out, and I entred.</p>
               <p>There did I behold the Power and Strength of Wine, how it had muſter'd and conquered all thoſe that had encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with it.</p>
               <p>The company in all conſiſting of five,

I ſaw one ſleeping in a Chair, another laid all along on a Bench, another in the ſame poſture and condition on the Table, the fourth dead drunk on the ground, having faln from his Chair, and my Maſter who had lately been aſleep, but was now Top-heavy, the onely moving perſon; come, ſaid he, we have had a merry frolliek, and they are aſleep, but I muſt awake them that we may be gone, <hi>but firſt let's drink;</hi> and thereupon ſtaggering towards him that lay upon the ground, and ſtradling over him, he puts the Bottle of Wine to his Noſe and takes a Swoop; he commanded me and the Drawer to do the like. I know not what he did, but I fetch'd a large draught: My Maſter then fell a leaping, ſtaggering, and dancing about his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, till in the end they awaked.</p>
               <p>They had hardly ſo much ſences as to know where they were, and what and how to pay their Reckoning. I wondred how they would get home, but their Quarters were not far off as I underſtood, they being all Priſoners in the <hi>Kings-Bench.</hi> I led my Maſter home however, and now I have done my ſtory, onely give me leave to add this Concluſion, That I hardly believe that

theſe my Maſters Companions being Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> as I ſuppoſe for Debt, have much Money to lend out at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: I am of your mind, and the whole is, replied the Gentleman, and by this I ſee I am led by the Noſe and fool'd. This is the truth Sir, ſaid I: I believe it, ſaid he, but you ſhould have told me this ſooner that I might not have loſt my time, but if I l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About three days after, I ſuppoſe this Gentleman met my Maſter abroad, what greeting or converſe they had together I know not, but I imagine it was none of the civilleſt, for my Maſter came home ſooner than ordinary, and ſeeing me, his firſt words were:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of my doors you Raſcal, you have broken your Indentures in betraying my ſecrets, you are a Rogue and a Raſcal, and I'le ſooner truſt a Thief than you in my Houſe.</hi> I ſtar'd on him, but he not ſeeing me ſtir, ſeized on my Arm buffeting and thruſting me, without hearing me ſpeak, he threw me out of the Shop.</p>

                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:107141:110"/>I being now out of Doors, was reſolved not to go in again, but walked directly to my two Aſſociates that were to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me in my <hi>French</hi> Journey. I had by good chance conveyed from my Maſters moſt of thoſe Books and other things that were of any worth, ſo that I was not wholly unprovided.</p>
               <p>I told my Companions I had broken the Ice, and was come away to haſten them, they promiſed to be ready in few days, deſiring me to diſpoſe of my ſelf near them: I did ſo, taking my Lodging at an Inn.</p>
               <p>I was reſolv'd not to return to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I ſhould be too near my Mother-in-law, who I doubted would have ſome ſcurvy Deſign upon me, and knowing that ſhe was for ſending me to Sea, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go without her ſending.</p>
               <p>Being now ſettled in my Lodging, again ſollicited my Companions to make haſte, they promiſed me to do ſo, and that I might be ſure of them, borrowed ſome Books of them, eſpecially of one of whom I had a Book worth above twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
               <p>This I was reſolv'd to keep as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement

My Father was ſixty when he died, and lived free from all Arreſts, though his Dealing were very conſiderable, and I by that time I was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to half his Age, had been arreſted I believe ſixty times: And I am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that Serjeants, Bailiffs, Marſhals Men, and ſuch kind of Varlets, have had as much Money of me at ſeveral times, as would pay all the Debts I at preſent owe, and yet I have always been ſparing and plaid the good Husband with them, they have uſually gained no more of me than needs muſt, and although I now have, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Many of theſe unlucky Caſes have hapned on me, and I being thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſo great neceſſity, miſery, and torment thereby; for to a generous, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, noble ſpirit, nothing elſe can be

more grieveous or intollerably miſerable, than to be put upon the neceſſity in theſe Affairs: Nay, I have been oftentimes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted for no cauſe but an humour, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Deſign of doing me miſchief, and that in a ſtrange unlucky manner. Would you not think it an unlucky thing to be thus in a manner cauſeſleſsly arreſted for a Book, and that before you were twenty years old? One would think that ſuch a matter as that between a couple of Boys (for we were neither of us any better) might have been ended without theſe Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, but you ſee ſo it was: Would not you think it was an unlucky thing, that you muſt be enforc'd to part from your Clothes off your back to ſatisfie a pitiful inconſiderable Debt that was never thought off, and indeed not due? Do you not think it an unlucky thing to be arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within a few days after you were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, for your Wedding-Clothes? And do you not think it much more unlucky to have thoſe very Clothes and your Wife's too, ſoon after ſeiz'd on and attach'd for Diet and Lodging, and that when both theſe parties had no reaſon to do it, being promiſed and aſſured their Moneys in a

few days; and which was paid accordingly, was not this ſuch a Misfortune as would try and vex your patience? Would it not appear to you an unlucky thing to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted for Gloves and Ribbons, pretended to be delivered at your Wedding, which were never ſo done, the Glover ſetting down almoſt as many Gloves again, as there were Folks at the Wedding? Do you think it was not unlucky, that when you had taken a new Houſe and Shop, and had but juſt turned the workmen out that had fitted it, newly ſwept the Shop to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cuſtomers, and before you had any entred upon that account, to have a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant enter and arreſt you, onely at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of a Servant without the Maſters conſent, would not ſuch handſale as this pleaſe you? Was it not think you, unlucky when you went to ſee a Priſoner, to be made one your ſelf, becauſe you would not give a roguiſh Bailiff Money for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Would it not above all things vex you, and would you not think your ſelf very unlucky, that going to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſee a Priſoner, at your coming out you ſhould be arreſted in three ſeveral Fob-Actions, but however put to charges, and

ſtaid at that very hour when you being a Widower were going to viſit a Widow, who at that inſtant expected you to appoint the time of Marriage to be within two dayes after, would not ſuch a Misfortune as this try all your patience? would you not think it a pitiful unlucky ſtory to be arreſted for five ſhillings by your Fellow-Citizen, which is contrary to City-Law, and by one that was a Member of the ſame Company with you, and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in five pound penalty not to arreſt each other without leave, would you not think this hard and unkind dealing, and forced to pay this five ſhillings, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, though none of your own Debt, and never demanded but in jeſt, and at laſt be made to pay it in earneſt? Would not you think you had very hard luck, if you in truſting others to receive and pay Rent for you, he ſhould be ſo negligent a Knave as to omit paying of Ground Rent, anu thereby your Eſtate be forfeited, and you forced to pay all Arrears beſides.</p>
               <p>Thus have I been twice ſerved to the loſs of two very conſiderable Leaſes? Would you not think it hard that you ſhould be arreſted for Money by a perſon
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107141:115"/>
that owes you the ſame Sum, this unlucky Trick I have been often ſerved? Would you not think him a Croſs-grain'd ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fellow, that ſhould go about enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to whom you owe Money, and ſet them all on to arreſt you, and rather than fail do it without leave at his own Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, was not this unlucky? Would you think any mans Malice ſhould extend ſo far as to purſue you ten or twelve Mile into the countrey (when you might be taken any day in <hi>London</hi>) and cauſe you to be arreſted on a Sabboth day as you were going to Church, in ſome ſolemnity of a Wedding, to hurry you away from friends onely to diſgrace and vex you and that without all need, for when the Money was in few days after paid, the Owner of it ſaid, You may keep it lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Was not this a mighty untoward and unlucky Action and full of Malice and Envy.</p>
               <p>Was it not a moſt unfortunate and a very unlucky thing, when your neareſt and thoſe that you took to be your dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Relations and Kinsfolks that they
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107141:116"/>
ſhould cauſe you to be arreſted and laid up there, and kept till you agreed to ſell an Eſtate you had no mind to part from, but by this means compelled? Would it not vex you, and you think your ſelf unlucky that having a hundred Pounds or more due to you from a perſon that was dead, and you endeavoring to enſure that, ſhould make your ſelf worſe by underſtanding his Debts, and be arreſted in four Actions in one day on his behalf? Was it not an unlucky diſgraceful trick to be followed near fifty Miles into the Countrey to a Fair, &amp; there hindred of your buſineſs and diſgraced, by being arreſted, and forced to pay Money to one who promiſed to repay it for you again, but did no ſuch matter, onely kept it and ſpent it himſelf, and left you to pay it over again, would it not vex you to be ſo cheated? But more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, would it not vex you having two peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to deal with, the Mother and the Son, that you ſhould pay Money to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in part, to her content, and ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to ſtay a longer time, but the Son contrary to this promiſe come and ſerve Execution on your Goods, and thereby ſeize and carry away Goods valued at
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107141:116"/>
forty pounds, but really worth a hundred, when as there was but fifteen due, and all this without any remedy, was not this an unlucky chance, and a very knaviſh Trick? Would not it vex you when two Knaves ſhould cauſe you to be arreſted, ſued, and to pay a Debt which they, and not you did really owe, and that one of theſe ſhould afterwards confeſs it on Condition you would remit him his part of it.</p>
               <p>And after all this, would you not think your ſelf unlucky if you ſhould employ Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to arreſt one who really owes you a conſiderable Debt, and thoſe very Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhould comply with your Debtor, and when you come to enquire of them what they have done, they ſhould then arreſt you in a Fobb-Action at his Suit, and give you great charge and trouble: If this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Debtor of yours (ſhould pretending to bring friends to treat with you) bring in other Officers who ſhould in all violent and villanous manner drag you away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Priſon, onely to enforce you to releaſe the other.</p>
               <p>All theſe unlucky perſecutions have I run through, and commonly I have been as unlucky in Suits of Law, both as <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:107141:117"/>
as <hi>Defendant.</hi> In one wherein I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged there was two hundred pounds ſpent ready mony on our part, and we with much difficulty received a hundred pound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition Money. If to have all theſe Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes and many more may be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>unlucky</hi> then I am ſo; by what I have reckoned up and by all that I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I believe I have been arreſted on idle, fooliſh, unjuſt and falſe Actions twice ſo often as for a real Debt, for I took all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible care to pay what I really owed, and that without trouble, but have been many times hindred by ſome of theſe <hi>unlucky</hi> Chances, and nothing hath troubled me ſo much as to pay that Money to theſe Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets which would have helped to have paid real Debts: Nay, as I have ſaid before, I believe that the Money that I have paid on theſe abominable Accounts, if now together, would pay all the Debts that I owe in the world, but I hope now to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that in little time, for I never owed ſo little for theſe fifteen years paſt as now I do, and that which I owe was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in better manner, being to few men, for I'le maintain it you were better owe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107141:117"/>
a hundred Pounds to one man than eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pounds to ten men, unleſs you have ready Money to pay it, for let your one man be what he will, never ſo ſevere, it is much if one of your ten, if not more of them, be not more ſevere than he, and then the Charges and the Diſgrace to be arreſted for a little Sum, is equal to, if not above that which is far exceeding in greatneſs.</p>
               <p>I was uſed formerly to reckon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs of my own Eſtate to conſiſt altogether in the great number of Houſes that I had, in the quantity of Goods at home and Debts that were ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me abroad, this is the ordinary way, and this was mine, but I reckon my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate beſt, becauſe now I oweleſs than ever.</p>
               <p>I had rather have an Eſtate of two Thouſand Pounds and owe but two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, than to have an Eſtate of four Thouſand Pounds ſuppoſed, and owe one Thouſand Pound out of it; for the Thouſand Pound debts oweing muſt be ſure to be paid and what is abroad uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to be gotten in: Nay, I had rather have noe Eſtate than h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I was free from any <hi>Officers,</hi> and therefore being at Liberty, went to ſee that friend the Scrivener that I had ſent for; I found him at home, and he thought to find me in the <hi>Compter;</hi> for as he told me, my Father being at his ſhop juſt as I ſent the Meſſenger, he heard the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, but would not himſelf come to me, nor permit him that I ſent for, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Action for which I was Arreſted to be conſiderable, he did beleive and reſolve I muſt be carryed to the <hi>Compter,</hi> whither he was willing I ſhould go, that I might be humbled, or at the beſt that I being <hi>a ſtayd man,</hi> he might know

Beſt of all ſaid I, I ſhall ſhift well enough for my ſelf; but what do you intend to do ſaid he? I intend to have no more Maſters of his chooſing, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to Travel and ſeek my Fortunes.

return'd to my Inn. I was now diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of my Companions who abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denyed to go along with me, but however I ſtill kept in the ſame mind of Travelling. I was viſited by two or three young fellowes that were ſons to a Widow, whom a Kinſman of mine had Married; they ſeeing my mony run away ſo faſt in the Inn, perſwaded me to leave that place and go to their houſe; they did not uſe many words to induce me to do that which I knew would be to my advantage, and therefore they carrying away my moveables (which cheifly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in Books) I ſoon followed them, leaving what ſcore I owed there to be paid by my two intended fellow-Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, by whoſe appointment I had come thither.

this happy life did ſo pleaſe me that I could not forbear but told my Coſin thereof, he did not like it ſo well as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, rayſing many objections, but I anſwered them all ſo throughly that my deſign ſeemed feaſable. My Father was told of my purpoſe, and with ſome perſwaſions was wrought to approve of it; then muſt a place be thought of, it muſt not be in <hi>London,</hi> I was like <hi>young Students in Divinity,</hi> not to enter <hi>a City Pulpit,</hi> but ſome adjacent ſmall Village, ſo I was not to be ſeen in <hi>London,</hi> but ſomewhere in the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> and at laſt the Tower Liberty was the place pitched on, and there was a Shop found for me, I was very glad of the news, and proud of my little Shop, for a great one it could not be of 40 <hi>s.</hi> a year Rent. It was ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate at an Alehouſe dore, and had ſerv'd for a Drinking room, and had a door into the houſe; but my Father, that I might not be too near the Alehouſe, and miſtake my dore and go in thither, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the old dore to be faſtned up, and a new one made another way, as far from the entrance into the Alehouſe as might be; he ordered all things as he pleaſed,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107141:124"/>
as it was fit he ſhould, becauſe he paid for all; but I gave order for putting up Shelves for my Books, and a Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, the Window glazed, and a Settle-bed and ſmall Featherbed and appurtenances put unto it, and a Desk bought and ſent in, I entred the Shop. My Father told me that I ſhould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without ſome money to keep me till Tradeing came, and therefore he gave me <hi>the mighty ſumm of Ten Shillings;</hi> for this was I thankful, and as well pleaſed as if I had been <hi>Dub'd a Knight.</hi> Never till then did I think my ſelf happy, and then I beleived I was ſo; I was free from all Commands, I could go to bed when I would, and riſe when I would, I could Eat and Drink when I pleaſed, Write and Read, walk abroad, or ſtay at home when I had a mind to it: So great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfaction is there in being at ones own diſpoſe, and truly I think my condition was better then, then ſince, becauſe I was without any Controle; and above all, I lived out of Debt and danger.

               <p>He conſidering of many things, at laſt doubted that <hi>Climanthus</hi> was the Author of this deſign, wherefore changing his ſhirt, that and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Linnen being in a <hi>pittiful pickle,</hi> he dreſſed himſelf, and went up to <hi>Climan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>'s Chamber; but ſo enraged that he could hardly ſpeak: <hi>Climanthus,</hi> who had heard all paſſages, and who indeed had no more harm in him then a <hi>Divel of two year old,</hi> made as if he were aſleep, and ariſing as if newly awaked, let him in, asking what was the matter. <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was ſo out of temper,</hi> that he could ſay nothing, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> with his Teeth and hands appeared in a threatning poſture, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretending not to underſtand him; whereupon he told him the ſtory, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that who ever had cauſed this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffront, was no better than a Sott. <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus</hi> ſeemed to be amazed, telling him that he did him much wrong if he ſuſpected him to have any hand in it, proteſting his ignorance, offering him his aſſiſtance in any Revenge upon thoſe that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:107141:132"/>
had done it if he could diſcover them, and that he himſelf would endeavour the Diſcovery and Revenge. Whereupon he left <hi>Climanthus,</hi> who riſing and being dreſſed, went into the preſence of that Perſon of Honour, whom they attended, and there he being of this Humor, that he had rather have the Anger and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of all the world, then loſe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of boaſting himſelf to be the Author of ſo honourable an Action, bragg'd of it to all the Family, obligeing them to make it a publick diſcourſe; and by this means <hi>Leander</hi> was well enough aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Author of this Affront, and was reſolv'd to <hi>Revenge</hi> it, at the peril of his life or any rate whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And thereupon he went to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his acquaintance, whom I ſhall call <hi>Lotarius,</hi> and who was a great Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the then <hi>Lieutenant of the Tower,</hi> he acquainted this Gentleman with the Affront, which he was reſolved to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> and therefore he deſired him on his behalf to acquaint <hi>Climanthus</hi> that he deſired to ſee him with his Sword in his hand, and withal, that he would be his Second; <hi>Latarius</hi> was <hi>no Novice in theſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:107141:133"/>
affairs,</hi> but conſidering ſoberly of the cauſe, and not being to be drawn by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Youthful Flaſh</hi> to an <hi>inconſiderate Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> although he was a brave and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man, and had upon ſeveral ſignal occaſions, given ſufficient proofs of his Valor; he therefore diverted him from theſe reſolves, ſaying, That the Cauſe was ſo Ridiculous, that there would be no Honour gained by a Combat occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned upon ſo Idle, Slender, and mean account. How then Replyed <hi>Leander,</hi> muſt I endure ſo baſe an Affront, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Revenge, and ſuffer my ſelf to be pointed at as I walk the Streets, and be thus outbraved. No ſaid <hi>Lotarius,</hi> I would have you Revenged, but in its kind, we ſhould make uſe of <hi>Strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>wit againſt wit, leave</hi> this affair to my management, and if I do not ſufficiently <hi>Revenge</hi> you, complain on me, <hi>Leander</hi> being ſatisfied, left him and his honour in his hands.</p>
               <p>I have already told you that <hi>Lotarius</hi> was in Favour with, and did belong to the <hi>Liuetenant of the Tower,</hi> who had ſo great a power in thoſe times, that if any ſpake againſt him or his Maſter <hi>Oliver,</hi> he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107141:133"/>
took courſe to chaſtiſe them, without any cauſe of Juſtice. <hi>Lotarius</hi> was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account very well acquainted with all the <hi>Warders, Souldiers,</hi> and <hi>Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and therefore he was reſolved to uſe his Intereſt with them to <hi>Revenge</hi> the Affront done to <hi>Leander;</hi> he therefore ſpake to a <hi>Corporal,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Fyle of Muſqueteirs to ſeize on <hi>Climanthus</hi> when ever they met with him; and alſo he told the <hi>Goalor</hi> that a Priſoner would be brought him, that ſhould be kept very cloſe, and none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſee or ſpeak with him, but by his order. The <hi>Corporal</hi> having ſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to find <hi>Climanthus,</hi> it was not long ere he ſeized him: it was no hard matter for him to do ſo, becauſe he ſuſpected nothing; but being taken, he demanded the cauſe of his Impriſonment; he was anſwered that he ſhould know that time enough, when he came to his Tryal. He being thus caught, was forced to go with them to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where the <hi>Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> being in expectation of him, readily received him, and put him into the place where he had deſigned. Poor <hi>Climanthus</hi> knew not who to apply himſelf unto; he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:107141:134"/>
ruminated on many things, but could not ſuſpect for what cauſe he had been Apprehended: after he had been there about an hour, <hi>Lotarius</hi> who was well acquainted with <hi>Climanthus,</hi> being as he pretended his particular friend, came to to viſit him in Priſon. At the firſt ſight he appeared mighty ſad and aſtoniſht, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Dear Friend, what is the meaning of this, I juſt now underſtood that you were a Priſoner, and therefore all buſineſs being laid aſide, I came to know the cauſe, and to make a tender to you of my utmoſt ſervice; <hi>Oh Friend,</hi> ſaid <hi>Climan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> I proteſt I know not for what cauſe I am Apprehended. If it be a Money bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſaid <hi>Lotarius,</hi> command all that I have, and if the ſumm be great, I have conſiderable Friends that ſhall furniſh me. No, no, replyed the other, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not for that, I owe none, but a little to my Landlord, and I know he would lend me upon occaſion all that he hath; have you beaten any body ſaid <hi>Lotarius,</hi> no ſaid he but ſomewhat is the matter; you are ſaid <hi>Lotarius,</hi> very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal in your Diſcourſe, and do not (when you are entred) care what you
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107141:134"/>
ſay; have you not in your uſual <hi>Railleries</hi> been accuſtomed to ſay ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Protector,</hi> the preſent <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or againſt the <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> here I know you are a little too <hi>Laviſh</hi> upon that account, and you know that in this Age, the very thoughts againſt the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> are <hi>criminal,</hi> and a word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Protector</hi> (being Treaſon) is <hi>preſent death.</hi> At this word he was as <hi>pale as Aſhes,</hi> for being a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> and that a bold one, he had not ſpared to ſpeak what he thought againſt the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:</hi> and after a little pauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving himſelf Guilty, he putting his hand to his Mouth, and lifting up his Eyes, cryed out <hi>I am undone,</hi> this muſt be the cauſe. If it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Lotarius,</hi> all that I can do is but to pitty you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know that you are in hands of thoſe that will ſhew none, eſpecially upon ſuch an Offence as yours is. I therefore will leave you at preſent, and ſee if I can ſerve you better abroad then here; I will therefore go and inform my ſelf, and return to acquaint you of my knowledge, and then you may conſider, wherein I can ſerve you.</p>

                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:107141:135"/>Hereupon our Priſoner was left alone, who did now certainly beleive that the <hi>Protector</hi> or <hi>Leiuetenant</hi> had cauſed him to be Apprehended, and that he ſhould be in very great danger of his life; <hi>Lotarius</hi> being reſolved to be fully <hi>Revenged</hi> on him for the Abuſe he had done his Friend, found out a <hi>Parſon</hi> who had been uſed in ſuch Caſes to Adminiſter <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual comfort</hi> to <hi>Condemned perſons,</hi> and prepare them for Death: He tells this <hi>Parſon</hi> that there was a poor Gentleman of his intimate Acquaintance, without any Formality of Juſtice, was Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have his Head Cut off, and that he was to be Executed that Evening; his Crime being only for ſpeaking againſt thoſe perſons that had the <hi>Reins of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> in their Power; that the poor Gentleman himſelf did not know of his Sentence, and very few others; that he would be very much ſurpriſed at the News of it; and therefore he deſired him to Viſit him, and prepare him in the beſt manner he could to receive his Death.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Doctor</hi> being uſed to theſe affairs, being told his Name and the place where he was Priſoner, promiſed to go
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107141:135"/>
to him preſently: But <hi>Lotarius</hi> went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and entring the Priſon ſeemed by his Countenance to be very much troubled; <hi>Oh dear Friend,</hi> ſaid he, I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right enough, for I underſtand that it is <hi>Oliver</hi> himſelf that is your Enemy, it is he that you have been too free with, and thereby angred him ſo highly, that there is no Pacification: what am I Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of ſaid <hi>Climanthus?</hi> I know not in Particular, ſaid <hi>Lotarius;</hi> but I could a hundred times eaſier have brought you off if you had killed twenty men, then for this Crime againſt this <hi>All-powerful Perſon;</hi> and you know in this caſe, I dare not ſpeak on your behalf; What then ſaid the other, in a deſperate tone, <hi>Muſt I dye then,</hi> at this word the <hi>Doctor</hi> ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and, hearing what he had ſaid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>and why not my good Friend;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that our good Lord himſelf was much more innocent, and he ſuffered Death. This diſcourſe was very terrible to our poor Priſoner, which <hi>Lotarius</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid, I pray comfort him whilſt I walk out and acquaint my ſelf further with his Affairs.</p>
               <p>He being now alone with the <hi>Doctor,</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:107141:136"/>
who was deceaſed by <hi>Lotarius</hi> as I have told you, he ſaid to him, my Friend, it is no time now <hi>to trifle and dream of the affairs of this World,</hi> you muſt prepare your ſelf for <hi>Death,</hi> you have not above two or three hours to live, you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. At theſe words, the poor <hi>Climan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed that he could not open his mouth, but being come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he cryed out aloud, and by theſe paſſionate ſallies, he made it evident that he was not in his right ſenſes; <hi>The Doctor</hi> ſeeing that, and being expert in theſe affairs, endeavoured by little and little <hi>to bring him to his Wits,</hi> telling him that this life and all the enjoyments of it, were nothing in compariſon of <hi>Eternity;</hi> and ſuch kind of Divinity he urged to him as is uſual in ſuch caſes, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I not being of that function, am not ſo well acquainted; but let this ſuffice to tell you, that with much pains he ſomewhat pacified him and brought him into a condition and temper more fit to be wrought upon: At his ſecond viſit which he promiſed him ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an hour, adviſing him in the mean time to examine his Conſcience; and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107141:136"/>
thus he left our poor Priſoner more than half dead, ſo that the <hi>Executioner</hi> ſhould have the leſs to do to finiſh his buſineſs. <hi>Lotarius</hi> having thus put the poor <hi>Climan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> into theſe mortal apprehenſions, did not think that his Revenge had as yet gone far enough, but was reſolved to proceed further in it, but ſo, as that Evening ſhould put a period to it; where again entring the Priſon, and fetching a deep ſigh, he ſaid; Ah dear Friend, I am come to tell you the ſad news of your Condemnation: I know it too well already, replyed the Priſoner, and that I muſt take my laſt leave of you and all my Friends; but let us conſider a little, replyed <hi>Lotarius,</hi> for I have been think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a way to ſave your Life; at this word the Priſoner opened his Eyes and Ears with much earneſtneſs, liſtning to his deſired propoſition; whereupon the other began. You are here a <hi>Priſoner</hi> for Crimes againſt the <hi>State,</hi> very few know of your Sentence, the Goal of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is ignorant of it; now mind what I ſay, continued he; yes, replyed the poor trembling Priſoner. You know, continued <hi>Lotarius,</hi> that Priſoners of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107141:137"/>
                  <hi>State</hi> do not uſe to continue here for a ſhort time; do you give out, that you believe your Impriſonment will be long, and ſay, that you will make proviſion of Wood and Char-coal againſt the Winter; do you but ſay ſo, and give me liberty to publiſh it. But to what purpoſe, ſaid the Priſoner? Why, I will go, ſaid <hi>Lotarius,</hi> and cauſe a <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> to come hither with Char-coal, who ſhall bring it into your Chamber, and I will engage him, for a ſum of money that I will give him, to reſolve when he is here to put on your Cloaths, and you ſhall take his, and your face being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured with the Char-coal you may have free paſſage; for taking you at your return to be the <hi>Collier</hi> you may paſs without any ſuſpition, and this I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe may be done without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: The <hi>Collier</hi> being willing enough to expoſe himſelf to the hazard of the matter for ſo conſiderable again; the poor <hi>Climanthus</hi> thought he was at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty already, as we uſually imagine all thoſe things to be eaſie which we paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſire; and therefore he earneſtly entreated and conjured <hi>Lotarius</hi> that he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:107141:137"/>
would promiſe the <hi>Collier</hi> all that he had, and that he would alſo be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him for his Life. <hi>Lotarius</hi> went now to ſeek a <hi>Collier,</hi> and made choice of one that was young without a beard, and had ſhort hair, and having a ſack of Coals on his back, hired him to go with him to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he being, as I told you, very well acquainted with the Goalor, he recounted the whole ſtory to him, and that his whole intention was to put our <hi>Priſoner</hi> into a great fear, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to aſſiſt him in the deſign, and to let him come out in the <hi>Colliers</hi> Cloaths without taking any notice of it. The Goalor, who would deny him nothing, knowing he was ſeized on by his order, agreed to what he requeſted, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore went up with the <hi>Collier</hi> into the Chamber, and there cauſed them with all expedition to exchange Cloaths. But <hi>Climanthus</hi> had a great beard, a large Perriwig, and ſome Locks of his own, and all theſe he muſt part from, or elſe he could not be like the <hi>Collier,</hi> and ſo might be in danger to be diſcovered. Theſe objections the <hi>Priſoner</hi> ſoon cleared by conſenting to part from all, and to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107141:138"/>
do or ſuffer any thing elſe that was thought convenient; ſo they plaid the Barber themſelves, and not only ſo, but they diſcoloured his face with Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal; and now he was ſo like the <hi>Collier</hi> in every point, that there was no doubt but he might paſs all the Guards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſuſpition. He being thus fitted, marched on; he paſſed the firſt and ſecond Guards without examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but at the third, the Goalor being minded to further the deſign of his Friend, and double the fear of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,</hi> ſtop'd him, ſaying, but let us look, is not this one of our Priſoners? Judge whether the poor <hi>Priſoners</hi> heart did not ake for fear of diſcovery; but he was in <hi>a little better taking</hi> when another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, no, no, this is the very <hi>Collier</hi> that paſſed by us not long ſince; let him go then, ſaid the Goalor, and ſo he did with all convenient ſpeed; but having reſolved to make towards his Lords Houſe and ſecure himſelf there, and it being at a conſiderable diſtance, he was doubtful if he went ſo far on foot he ſhould run very great hazard of being diſcovered; wherefore he thought beſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:107141:138"/>
to take a Boat, and therefore hied him to the ſtairs, but there he was put into <hi>mortal apprehenſions of danger;</hi> for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Gentlemen that were there on purpoſe, ſaid to one another, look you, <hi>that Collier is very like</hi> Climanthus. This gave him great fear, and with much trembling he entred the Boat, and the Gentlemen ſtill continuing their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and pointing to him, he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they might betray him, cryed to them, <hi>For the Lords ſake hold your Tongues.</hi> The Boat putting off, in ſhort time he was arrived at the watering place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Lords Houſe, where he Landed, and walking towards the Houſe, he there ſaw the Noblemen &amp; ſeveral of his Friends and Attendants; who being acquainted with the deſign, waited there in expectation of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Conſider him then in a <hi>Colliers</hi> Habit, his face all black, his <hi>Muſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes cut off;</hi> and thus ſhamefully diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed approaching the preſence of his Lord; <hi>Climanthus</hi> ſeeing him, cryed out, <hi>Save my Life my Lord.</hi> The Lord ſeeming not to underſtand him forbid him entrance into his Houſe, ſaying,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:107141:139"/>
                  <hi>Whither goes this Raſcal? Ah my Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am</hi> Climanthus, <hi>ſave my life I beſeech you;</hi> At this the Lord ſeemed aſtoniſhed and ſurpriſed, but calling him to mind, asked him the reaſon of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, which he told him in great fear and trouble; whilſt the Auditors, who were acquainted with the ſtory, took as much pleaſure, <hi>and dyed almoſt with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But the end of the Adventure was this, that his fear put him into a Fever, which kept him three moneths in his bed and Chamber, out of which he durſt not go till his <hi>Beard</hi> and <hi>Hair</hi> were grown again. At length he knew the whole ſtory, whereupon he talked of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on <hi>Leander</hi> and <hi>Lotarius;</hi> but his Friends told him there was no reaſon for it, becauſe he gave the firſt offence, and that he could not be juſtly offended if they had <hi>out-witted him in their Revenge.</hi> In fine, the Friends of all ſides made peace, and reconciled them together; and I think that this conceit exceeded that of the <hi>Clyſter,</hi> and that <hi>Leander</hi> was <hi>doubly Revenged.</hi> If the Law of <hi>Reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> had been ſtudied, <hi>Climanthus</hi> had <hi>hard meaſure,</hi> becauſe he was put in great
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:107141:139"/>
fear of his life, when as all that was intended againſt the other was but <hi>the fowling of his linnen.</hi> If the Law of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation</hi> was conſidered, it may be it was in this point, that as the one would be neceſſitated to <hi>foul his linnen by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Clyſter,</hi> ſo the other would be in the ſame caſe, or as bad, <hi>by the effects of his fear.</hi> Whether his fear produced ſuch effects, I know not; but I think it was very conſiderable, and raiſed to the greateſt and higheſt pitch: for a man to be clapt into Priſon, and detained there without the liberty of being viſited by Friends, would certainly produce much fear and trouble, but to be told that his <hi>very life was in hazard,</hi> would much raiſe it, and to be aſcertained of it by Friends, and the viſit of a ſpiritual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who is uſually the laſt acquaintance a man hath in this World, was ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute an aſcertaining of the truth, that nothing could be more: it was enough to depreſs and tame the moſt Jocoſe and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt ſpirit in the World: what would he not give, what would he not do or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to be delivered from this fear? You may judge that as well and ſtrangely

                  <p>The Author relates a Comical Story of a Purſe of Money found in a Church; and a Tragical ſtory of an Arch-Biſhop and Shoomaker.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANd now ſure I have finiſhed this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wherein I have had ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations &amp; Reflexions upon the word <hi>Retal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> and having heard of ſuch a Law, it put's me in mind of a <hi>Story</hi> and that a <hi>Comical</hi> one, wherein the Law of <hi>Retal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> was very pleaſantly put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; the ſtory is in ſhort thus; An ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Good Fellow</hi> that had ſpent all his Money, knew not where to get more, nor how to beſtow his time for want of that <hi>neceſſary Companion;</hi> for want of which all his <hi>companions</hi> had left him, he takes the honeſt and Pious reſolve of going to <hi>Church,</hi> being there and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at his Devotions when he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them, and went to ariſe, he ſaw
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107141:177"/>
on one ſide of him a <hi>Purſe,</hi> which ſeizing on, by the bulke and weight, he gueſſed there was <hi>Money</hi> in it; he ſoon opening it, and finding it to be ſo in earneſt, you may judge he was not diſpleaſed but joyful of his good fortune, and that he ſhould have ſo conſiderable a reward for his Devotion; he clapping the <hi>Purſe</hi> into his <hi>Pocket,</hi> went to find ſome of his Acquaintance that were in the <hi>Church,</hi> he waiting at the door, took them up as they went out, and being overjoyed at his <hi>good luck,</hi> he told them that he had met with a <hi>Priſe,</hi> and that ſuch a one as would make him and them merry, and therefore if they would go with him to the Cooks, they ſhould be his Gueſts; and that he would feaſt them at his own Charges; this was heard by the <hi>Sexton of the Church,</hi> but he underſtood not what was meant by, it. Our <hi>Goodfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi> Companions were not at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the propoſition, but went together to a houſe not far from that place; there they <hi>ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, drank and were mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and there I will leave them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to tell you that this <hi>Purſe</hi> was not directly <hi>dropt from Heaven,</hi> nor laid in
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:107141:177"/>
that place on purpoſe for our <hi>Goodfellow:</hi> No, it had an <hi>Owner,</hi> who was in as great <hi>trouble</hi> for the <hi>loſs</hi> of it, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>joyful;</hi> for the <hi>Owner</hi> having been at <hi>Church,</hi> and that at his Devotions in the next adjoyning place to our <hi>Goodfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> had by ſome accident dropt his Purſe, and going out of the <hi>Church</hi> in the croud of People, was ignorant of his loſs, but when he came to walk alone, he was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that his <hi>Pocket</hi> was lighter then it had been, and putting his hand into it, miſſed his <hi>purſe</hi> &amp; <hi>money.</hi> He ſearched &amp; groped both his <hi>pockets</hi> and <hi>Breeches,</hi> but he made no diſcovery, and ſo ſeized he was, that he knew not what to think, nor to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine where or how he had loſt it; He remembred he had it when he went to Church, and therefore concluded that he muſt loſe it there or in his return, and that his <hi>pocket had been pick't,</hi> or elſe, that it had dropt out. He feared the firſt, and then he knew there was no <hi>remedy,</hi> no <hi>recovery;</hi> but however having a mind that it ſhould be ſo, he hop'd that it had dropt out of his <hi>pocket</hi> at <hi>Church,</hi> and that there he ſhould find it; whereupon he haſtned thither, and finding the <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:107141:178"/>
tells him of his loſs, who aſſiſts him in ſearching for it, but in vain, at length the <hi>Sexton</hi> remembred that he heard our <hi>Goodfellow</hi> invite his Friends to a <hi>Collation,</hi> and that he did believe he had found it, he acquaint's the <hi>Owner</hi> of the <hi>Purſe</hi> of his knowledge, who concludes that it muſt be, that certainly that man had taken it up: he being told of the houſe he was gone to, was reſolved to go to him, but believing or doubting there might be occaſion for an <hi>Officer,</hi> he found one out and carryed him with him; being thus accompanied, he entred the houſe, and enquiring for ſuch Gueſts, was ſoon told where they were, he went to them, and thus told them his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he had that day loſt a <hi>Purſe of money</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> that he underſtood one of that Company had taken it, and therefore he demanded reſtoration. Our <hi>Goodfellow</hi> that had found it was very <hi>blanck,</hi> but withal being very honeſt, and knowing it would be a folly to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, for he had it about him, and had diſcourſed too largely in the houſe, of his Purchaſe to be concealed: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ownes the finding of the <hi>Purſe</hi> and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107141:178"/>
                  <hi>Money,</hi> but withal deſires to know the Marks of the <hi>Purſe</hi> and quantity of the <hi>Money;</hi> he is particularly told the marks of the <hi>purſe,</hi> and that there was in it 5 <hi>l.</hi> juſt; he therefore takes out the <hi>purſe,</hi> pours out the <hi>Money</hi> and tells it over, and finding there was 4 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> in it, he ſays truly Maſter it is very right, here is 4 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> and 5 <hi>s.</hi> which I have ſpent of it, makes it very right to a Farthing, and therefore you may have it? Nay but ſaid the <hi>Owner,</hi> what muſt I have? all that I have ſaid our <hi>good-fellow,</hi> you can have no more, for 5 <hi>s.</hi> is ſpent. I care not for that ſaid the <hi>Owner,</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> there was, and 5 <hi>l.</hi> I will have; but you cannot ſaid one, <hi>you can have no more of a</hi> Cat <hi>then her skin,</hi> nor no more Money of me then I have left? but I will ſaid the other; and thereupon he commands the <hi>Officer</hi> to <hi>lay hold</hi> on the <hi>Good Fellow,</hi> which he hearing firſt <hi>layes hold</hi> of the <hi>Money</hi> and puts it into his <hi>pocket,</hi> and ſeeing that he muſt be <hi>troubled</hi> for the <hi>mony,</hi> he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it ſhould not be for ſo ſmall a parcel as 5 <hi>s.</hi> but for it all; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to eſcape if he could; he <hi>gives them the ſlip</hi> and away he runs out of the

to eſcape. Well ſaid the <hi>Judge,</hi> I ſhall do you All Juſtice, I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that <hi>Retalliation</hi> is the beſt Law, and the moſt equitable; and therefore I do order, that ſince 5 s. of the 5 l. is ſpent, and that the <hi>Delinquent</hi> cannot return the <hi>purſe</hi> juſt as it was, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtill keep it all untill ſuch time as he hath made it up 5 l. quite, and then to deliver it. As for the <hi>Owner</hi> of the <hi>Aſs,</hi> I order that the <hi>Delinquent</hi> take the <hi>Aſs</hi> into his Cuſtody and Poſſeſſion, and keep and uſe him untill ſuch time as he hath another <hi>Tail</hi> like the former, that it may be reſtored in the ſame condition it was? and as for the <hi>Woman,</hi> that ſhe may be rendred to the <hi>Husband</hi> in as good caſe as ſhe lately was, before this da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, I order that the <hi>Delinquent</hi> take the <hi>Woman,</hi> provide for, and keep her till ſhe is well again, and lye with her untill ſuch time as ſhe be as far gone with <hi>Child,</hi> as ſhe was before the miſcheif; that her Husband may have her, and a Child in the ſame forwardneſs? And laſtly, as for the <hi>Officer,</hi> ſince the <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> ought to have the ſame injury of a broken Arm, and that it may be <hi>Rettal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:107141:146"/>
and done in the ſame manner, I order that he aſcend the <hi>Ladder,</hi> and fall down upon the <hi>Offender,</hi> and break his Arm as the others is broken. This was the <hi>Judgement</hi> and Order of our <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and now I ſuppoſe you are of my opinion, and think that he was very well Read in the Lawes of <hi>Retalliation.</hi> Whether this his Judgement were pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually performed, I know not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the <hi>Delinquent</hi> care, for he was to be no loſer; but however it went with them, I have done with their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and if this <hi>Retalliation</hi> hath been <hi>Comical,</hi> as in my opinion it is, I ſhall acquaint you with another that was as abſolute <hi>Retalliation;</hi> but withal, it is ſo <hi>Tragical,</hi> that I may truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly term it <hi>Revenge,</hi> and that in as great a height as ever I knew any the quallity of the perſons conſidered: But in relating this, and ſome other Stories that I have for you, I muſt play the <hi>Ill Husband,</hi> and leave my Shop, I muſt travel into <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> my <hi>Scene</hi> will lye there a while; I ſhall not tell you of any <hi>Engliſh Stories,</hi> that you know or may have read already, I ſhall not make uſe

I am ſure thoſe Stories muſt be good, for our <hi>Engliſh Comedies</hi> and <hi>Tragedies,</hi> exceed all other Nations now in every thing; I know that the <hi>French</hi> did exceed us in <hi>Ornaments</hi> of the <hi>Stage, Gallantry</hi> of <hi>Apparel, variety</hi> of <hi>Muſick</hi> and <hi>Dancing, pleaſantneſs</hi> of the <hi>Scenes,</hi> and <hi>ſtrangneſs</hi> of their <hi>Machines:</hi> But now we are grown up to them, and in all things equal them in theſe outſide mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and as to the inſide, the <hi>ſoul</hi> of the Play, which is the <hi>Plot,</hi> Contrivance and Language we ſtill out do them and all the world.

a very good <hi>Ponyard;</hi> reſolved to do this Execution the next day, which was to be the Feaſt of the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> even in the <hi>Kings</hi> preſence. He knew that this great <hi>Porceſſion</hi> would be the next day, which in that Country is moſt <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> where the <hi>Arch Biſhop</hi> would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with his Train in <hi>Pontifical</hi> Habits, near to the <hi>Arch Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Sevil,</hi> he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him till he came juſt againſt the <hi>Palace Royal,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> and all the Court were at the Windows to behold the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> paſs by. There he being reſolved, and provided, aiming right at his <hi>Heart,</hi> gave him two ſo great Stroaks with his <hi>Ponyard,</hi> that he fell down ſtark-dead at his feet. The horror of this ſtrange <hi>Spectacle,</hi> gave <hi>aſtoniſhment</hi> to all the <hi>Spectators.</hi> He was ſeized on to be carried to Priſon, that he might have ſevere Juſtice. There was ſo great a noiſe, that the <hi>King</hi> doubting what it was, asked what was the matter: He was told of the boldneſs of this <hi>Wretch,</hi> who was leading to Priſon. The <hi>King</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that he ſhould be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and for aſmuch as every one
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:107141:151"/>
knew that the <hi>King</hi> was a ſevere <hi>Juſticer,</hi> as I have already ſaid, having for that cauſe the name of <hi>Cruel</hi> attributed to him, every one expected from him no other thing but a <hi>Horrible puniſhment,</hi> for ſo Deteſtable a Crime. The <hi>King</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Priſoner before him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this Honourable Aſſembly, with a Grave voice, ſaid to him: <hi>come hither Traytor and Wretch that thou art;</hi> what wicked Spirit hath carried you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo enormous a Crime, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God and in my ſight, &amp; on a day ſo holy as this is. The <hi>Shoomaker</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intereſt he had with His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> was reſolved to anſwer boldly; wherefore without any ſurpriſe he thus reply'd: Wherefore Sir, had he the boldneſs to cauſe my Father to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered as he did, and although I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times demanded Juſtice; I have bin denied it, wherefore have I not reaſon to do it my ſelf. Every one was aſtoniſhed at this bold anſwer: But thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the <hi>Arch Biſhop,</hi> alleadged before the King that this was falſe, and that his Complaint had been heard and that Juſtice had been done him. What
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107141:152"/>
Juſtice was ſufficient for me, anſwered the Shoomaker ſo long as he was alive? The King would then know what Juſtice had been rendred unto him, it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> had been condemned <hi>not to ſay Maſs for a whole year,</hi> and that that was a very great Infamy to a perſon of his condition and quality. And why then ſaid the King was not this ſatisfation enough to you? No Sir re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Shoomaker, becauſe he had Means enough without that. The King asked him what Trade he was of, he anſwered a Shoomaker, <hi>go then ſaid the King, for a puniſhment of thy Crime; I command thee that thou be a whole year with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making Shoes;</hi> and that he might have Means to live upon, he aſſigned him a good Penſion for life, out of the <hi>Arch-Biſhops</hi> Eſtate. And now I think heer was <hi>Retalliation,</hi> abſolute Revenge, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and Juſtice, Retribute; whether the King did deſerve the attribute of <hi>Cruel</hi> I will leave the Reader to judge.

               <argument>
                  <p>A Cut-purſe Revenged of a Hangman, by giving him a caſt in his own Office; and two Cut-purſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of another Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by whipping.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN a certain Town of <hi>Normandy,</hi> a Cutpurſe having been taken in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fact, was condemned to be whipt on three Market days at a Carts-tail, thorough all the Streets of the Town. As our <hi>Delinquent</hi> was led to the Cart, he prayed the Hangman to uſe him kindly; but having not wherewithal <hi>to greaſe him in the hand,</hi> he cauſed him to know that he had a heavy one, and ſlaſhed him in ſuch manner, that his ſhoulders were Painted bravely, and he cried out loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: when he had been thus accomodated,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107141:186"/>
he had his liberty. This Cutpurſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been thus harſhly uſed by the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was reſolved what ever it coſt him, to be revenged. He was abſent from that Country about a year, at the end whereof he returned to inform himſelf of the name of this Hangman, and of all his Family; in which he had ſo good Intelligence, that he could eaſily have renewed his <hi>Genealogy,</hi> if in caſe it had been loſt. He by that means, knew that he had a <hi>Nephew,</hi> who in his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful days went into <hi>Italy,</hi> who had left his Country when very young, and that it had been 15. or 20. years ſince he had been heard of; he likewiſe underſtood that this <hi>Nephew</hi> was about his age, and having a deſign to paſs for him with the Hangman his Uncle, he informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of ſeveral particulars that might aſſiſt him therein: being perfectly inſtructed in all things neceſſary, and being very well clothed, he went to find the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a Country Houſe which he had, and whither he was gone for his Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and believing that he needed not to doubt of being known by him, becauſe it was a year and more, ſince <hi>he paſſed
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:107141:186"/>
through his hands,</hi> and that many others had had the like Courteſie of his Office, both before and after, whom he knew not, and that he had hardly ſeen any part of him but his ſhoulders which were ſufficiently diſguiſed; He being come to this Country Houſe, went boldly to the Hangman, and in his ſalutation called him Uncle. The Hangman returned his ſalutation but coldly, as not knowing him: whereupon the other ſaid, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Uncle that I have not the Honour to be known by you: I am the ſon of ſuch a one, I am your <hi>Nephew</hi> that am lately come out of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Hangman was ſurpriſed as a perſon whom he had heard ſpoken of, although he never ſeen him, he was aſtoniſhed to ſee him ſo well grown, and kindly received him, asking him an account of his Voyage, to whom he made ſuch anſwers as he had reſolved on before hand. The Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man calling him <hi>Nephew,</hi> asked him if he had ſeen his Father; He repl'd yes, but he had been troubled for the death of his Mother. The one enquired one thing of his Uncle, and the other asked another thing of his Cozen; and the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> himſelf, anſwering him readily to all queſtions. In fine, he appeared ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every particular, that if he ſhould after that have ſaid he had not been his <hi>Nephew,</hi> he would hardly believe him. They ſupped together, this Uncle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him very welcome; and then they went to Bed, riſing early the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the Uncle was to go to a Fair that was kept about half a Mile off, to receive certain Rights that were due to him in reſpect of his Office. This <hi>Nephew</hi> deſired that he might have the honour to wait on him thither, to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Fair (intending there to put his Project of Revenge in Execution, as he did.) His Uncle conſenting to it, they Breakfaſted, and after that put on towards the place intended, the way being but ſhort, they were ſoon there, but ſtay'd till the arrival of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. When he ſaw his Uncle buſy about receiving his Due, our <hi>Drole</hi> had a mind to put a part of his Craft in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and being a <hi>very good Workman at his Trade, an able man in his Profeſſion;</hi> he
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:107141:187"/>
ſaw a certain Merchant who came to buy Goods at the Fair, take ſome Gold out of a Purſe that he had about him; he was therefore reſolved to put his Skill in practice to be Maſter of the Purſe. He <hi>followed him with his eye,</hi> and ſaw him bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in ſelling a Sack of Corn, where he had occaſion to uſe both his hands. Our Curpurſe ſeeing ſo fir an opportunity, was reſolved not to loſe it, and being a <hi>cunning fellow at his Buſineſs,</hi> he cut the Merchants purſe ſo, that he nor none elſe that were near him did perceive it; and at that very inſtant, he went to find out his Uncle; and having taken him aſide that no body might hear, he told him in his ear, that he had ſome Mony about him which he was afraid to loſe, and therefore he deſired him to keep it for him; the Hangman willingly agreed to it, and taking the Purſe which he gave him, clapt it into his pocket with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking on it. Soon after this Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſe went to the Merchant, whoſe purſe he had taked, and taking him aſide, told him he would acquaint him with ſomewhat of Importance. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant hearkned very attentively, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:107141:188"/>
our Gallant asked him where was his Purſe, and the Merchant ſearching his pocket where he had put it, and where he believed it was, was amazed and troubled that he could not find it; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not your ſelf ſaid the other, I know very well where it is, and ſhewing him the Hangman at ſome diſtance, ſaid to him, look you, do you ſee that man in that place, I ſaw him cut your Purſe, while you were ſelling a ſack of <hi>Wheat?</hi> Seize upon him, for without doubt he hath it in his Pocket. As ſoon as he had ſaid thus, he made his eſcape without being ſeen of any body. The Merchant finding out an Officer, cauſed him to ſeize the Hangman, who <hi>taking by the Coller, dragged him before a Judge;</hi> the poor Hangman was amazed at what they ſaid and did, but the Merchant called him Cutpurſe before the Judge, ſaying that he had cut his, praying that might be ſearched, deſcribed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of the Purſe, and all the ſeveral peices of Gold and Silver that was in it. The Judge could not refuſe ſo reaſonable a Requeſt: therefore commanding that he ſhould be ſearched, found the Purſe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:107141:188"/>
ſuch as the <hi>Merchant</hi> had ſpecified, and the ſame pieces of Money which he had named: To this the <hi>Hangman</hi> know not what anſwer to give, but that this <hi>Purſe</hi> belonged to a <hi>Nephew</hi> of his that was in the Fair, that he had given it him to keep, deſired that he might be ſought for, deſcribing him by his Habit, Hair, and other marks; ſearch was made for him on all hands, but to no purpoſe, ſo that every one believed that this was a pretence, thinking by that means to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, but ſeeing the ſtrings of the <hi>Purſe</hi> were cut, and being compared with thoſe in the <hi>Merchant's pocket,</hi> they were found to be the ſame, upon ſo clear a proof in a perſon ſo publick as he, who being ordained for the puniſhment of others, ought to be without reproach, the leaſt faults that were done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being <hi>Criminal</hi> in him, he, was by the <hi>Iudge</hi> of the place, <hi>judged</hi> worthy of death, and condemned <hi>to be hanged and ſtrangled;</hi> but he appealed to the Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Roan</hi> which was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſeven or eight miles diſtant: Our <hi>Cutpurſe</hi> who was acquainted how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters went cutting off his Beard and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:107141:189"/>
Hair, and putting on a different habit, and clapping a great Plaiſter on one of his Eyes, went after him; he feared not to be diſcovered by his <hi>Uncle;</hi> there did he wait to hear the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> uppon the Appeal, but all the Court with one conſent confirmed the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and becauſe there was no body to hang him, by reaſon he was the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, this falſe <hi>Nephew</hi> offered his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſaying, that if they would pay him, he deſired no more but to get mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and he would execute the <hi>Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There being not many who are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of ſuch an Office, they were glad to accept of him, promiſing him good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo they ſent him to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned perſon, who was ſtill in one tale, proteſting his innocency, ſaying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that his <hi>Nephew</hi> had given him this <hi>Purſe</hi> to keep, but he had been as good to have ſaid nothing, or have ſung Ballads.</p>
               <p>Being brought to the place where the Execution was to be done, the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies being performed, the <hi>New Hangman</hi> mounted the Ladder, faſtning the Rope, and was in all things ready, expecting
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:107141:189"/>
him to ſay his laſt Prayers, and take his leave of the world; but before he turn'd him off, whiſpering him in the Ear, he ſaid, now my friend, do you remember that about a year ago you <hi>whipt</hi> me, and that I promiſed you I would be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of you, I am he that came to your Countrey-houſe who paſſed for your <hi>Nephew,</hi> who cut the purſe which I gave you to keep, on purpoſe to ſee you in the condition you are in; when this poor <hi>Hangman</hi> heard this, he cryed out, <hi>Sirs,</hi> but the other being ready and nimble turn'd him off, cauſing him to leave his intended ſpeech unfiniſhed, ſaying, you have ſaid enough already: He was blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for being ſo ſuddain, people ſaying that it may be he had ſomewhat of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to confeſs, but our Gallant who knew well enough that he had nothing to ſay but to his prejudice, replyed, that if he ſhould have let him alone, he would have talked till to morrow, and ſo he was excuſed as having but little judgement in ſuch affairs; he was very well contented for his pains, but much better pleaſed that he was <hi>ſo throughly revenged.</hi>

               <p>A Gentleman aſſiſted by two of his Servants, to revenge himſelf of one that had offended him, who was not of his quality, aſſaſſinated him at a Woods ſide in Lower <hi>Normandy</hi> about eighteen or twenty Miles from <hi>Roan.</hi> For this Fact, he was impriſoned at the place, and, by the Judges there, was Condemned to have his Head cut off; he appealing to the <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Roan,</hi> was carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and there kept Priſoner with his two Servants; who, pleading that they did not conſent to the Murther, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcharged from the ſame by their Maſter, were acquitted, but not ſo, but that as they had been preſent at the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they were Condemned to be Whipt through the Streets, and the Sentence againſt the Maſter, was confirmed; and it was further ordered, that his Head ſhould be carried to the place where the Murther had been commited.

After this execution was done: the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence further declared, that they ſhould appear in the ſame condition when their Maſters Head was cut off: this was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe performed, and then they had Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to go whither they pleaſed. They being at liberty, were reſolved to be Revenged on the <hi>Hangman,</hi> who had dealt ſo unkindly with them, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was to carry their Maſters Head to the place where the Murther was committed, and that he was to take up his Quarters for that night by the way; they reſolved to follow him; he coming to the place intended, there took up his Lodging; they ſaw him houſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hour after, they came likewiſe to the ſame Houſe, one of them brought a Fardle, where was about 2 Dozen of bundles of good luſty <hi>Burchin</hi> Rods, which they had provided for their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded deſign: and being very well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed that they might not be known by the <hi>Hangman,</hi> who had given them a <hi>Reliſhing taſte of his Office:</hi> they entred the Inn, and asked for a Supper and a Bed.

with Gueſts, and the Hoſteſs not well knowing how handſomly to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate them; they told her that they did not much matter it, if they had not a private Chamber to themſelves, they would be contented to lye in a Chamber where other Folks did, &amp; that they were ſo indifferent both as to their lodging, that they ſhould be content to take up their chamber, &amp; ſup with any other company that would accept of them. Sir ſaid the Hoſteſs, it is not above an hour ſince a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honeſt man came in hither, who is all alone and in a Chamber himſelf, where there is too Beds, and I believe he will be glad of Company: you may ſup to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and he ſhall lye in one of the Beds, and you in the other. We ſhall be very glad of ſo good company, ſaid one of them, if he will permit it: the Hoſteſs ſaid ſhe would go ask him, and ſo ſhe did. The <hi>Hangman</hi> conſidering that thoſe of his profeſſion were generally hated of all the World, that every body ſhuns them, and that they are always neceſſitated to eat alone, was very glad of this occaſion, and therefore told her that they ſhould be very welcome; they

Shee took no great heed to this diſcourſe, and they when the Beds were made, did all undreſs themſelves to go to bed.

off their ſhirts being ſtark naked, They thus beſpake their Chamber-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Look you friend, do you know us, you may ſee the <hi>work of your hands,</hi> and that <hi>we carry your marks upon our ſhoulders;</hi> but before we leave you, you ſhall be in the ſame condition, and with that, they fell upon him, and becauſe they could not pull off his ſhirt, they toar it: and he now being naked, Slapt and Jerkt him with all their ſtrength. He cryed out <hi>Help, Murther,</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> The Hoſt had a minde to go up and ſee what was the matter, but the Hoſteſs hindred him; ſaying, that they only paſſed the time in ſport, which one of them had told her of. But the cries redoubled as their blows, and as faſt as they wore out their Rods, they took freſh ones. The Hoſt and Hoſteſs hearing this, went to the door, but finding it ſo faſt and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricadoed,</hi> asked what was the matter; one of the <hi>Goodfellows</hi> anſwered, nothing, But the <hi>Hangman</hi> continuing his cries. The Hoſt and Hoſteſs were reſolved to enter by force, but could not untill all the Rods were almoſt ſpent, and that the poor <hi>Hangman</hi> had his ſhoulders hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly

Cheaquered, and the blood ran down on all ſides. The two Companions ſeeing that it was almoſt well, and that the door would be broken open, therefore one of them opened it: the Hoſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſs entring, and ſeeing them in that pickle, wondred, look you ſaid one of the companions, what reaſon he had to make ſuch a bauling noiſe, we Laſhed one another for Pleaſure, we have not uſed him worſe then he hath done us, and yet he cryed out the loudeſt. They ſhewed their ſhoulders and bid them look how he had Be-laced them. Thoſe who were entred the Chamber, ſeeing that there was but little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them all three, and that they had bled alike; they went down and ſhut the door after them, reſolving to let them Slaſh one another at their pleaſure, and not to take notice of, or be concerned at what cries ſoever they ſhould hear, which our two companions underſtanding, they renewed their Sport to their own Content and liking, but to the great Pain and trouble of our poor <hi>Hangman,</hi> whoſe poor back and ſhoulders paid for all. And ſo having worn out all their Rods, and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:107141:161"/>
wearied themſelves, they were forced to give over, and ſo ended the Whipping Adventure.</p>
               <p>Here again was <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Retallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> But as in the former, the poor <hi>Hangman</hi> was Innocent, he had but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his Office. But you ſee it is good to be Kind, and not to be troubleſome in any Office, leſt at one time or another, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, when unlook'd for, overtake them. And by this, as by my former Stories, <hi>Revenge</hi> is much deſired and thirſted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

               <p>The next ſtory I related to you, was of a Purſe of money found at Church, this was <hi>Comical</hi> enough, but withal you may conclude there was much <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckyneſs</hi> in it.

               <p>The writeing of this Treatiſe was firſt occaſioned by the recital of theſe two lines.</p>

                  <l>The lucky have their dayes and theſe they chuſe.</l>

               <p>The truth of this aſſertion hath been already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cleared, but however take an other ſtory or two along with you.</p>
               <p>About fourteen years ſince a Gold-ſmith living in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> riſing more early than his Neighbours as being deſirous to thrive according to the Proverb, was in a fair way to do ſo, his <hi>lucky</hi> day was come, for earely in the morning as he was opening his ſhop, a Seaman came to him with a Bag in his hand, and tells him that in a late Voyage to Sea, he had met with a prize, of what valew he knew not; for it was ſtones which he there had in his bag, &amp; drawing out a parſel preſented them to the Gold-ſmith, who preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering what they were, asked the ſaylor what he would have for them, five pound ſaid the Saylor, three ſaid the Goldſmith, the Saylor underſtanding by this offer, that they were of value, would have his full demands five pound: which the Goldſmith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to give, and let the Saylor go away; but not ſo far but that he had him in call, and ſoon finiſhed his bargain: no ſooner was the Seaman gone, but up goes the Goldſmith to his wife, finding her a ſleep, awakes her and tells her that ſhe lay there at her her eaſe: and ſo ſhe might do, and he take his for the future, for he had that morning met with ſuch a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:107141:168"/>
as would keep them and a Coach and Horſes as long as they lived; the Wife was glad of this news, and enquiers into the particulars, which he ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints her with, how that he had bought for five pounds a parcel of Diamons worth above 20000 l. <hi>great</hi> was their joy, but <hi>little</hi> was their prudence, here was <hi>luck in a Bag,</hi> if they could but keep it, but the Woman according to the quality of her ſex: could not be content to <hi>fare well, but ſhe muſt cry roaſt meat;</hi> and being ſoon after at a Goſhipping, ſhe there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes her Husbands good fortune. I may well ſay proclaim for it proved ſo: being ſoon noiſſed about to all parts of the Town: when marke the effects in a few dayes, he was taken out of his ſhop by a file of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-teers, and upon examination the beſt tale he could tell, being they were taken at Sea, they were judged to belong to the high court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, and therefore taken from him; thus did he looſe his Prize by his Wives tatling, this <hi>lucky</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain was not to prove ſo to him, neither in the whole nor in part, for although he had ſecured two or three thouſand pounds worth of them before this ſeizure: yet they did not thrive with him: for in few years after he broke. Thus did <hi>Fortune</hi> ſhew him one <hi>lucky hour,</hi> which he looſing could never redeem, and broke, and all came to nothing: this I think is an <hi>unlucky ſtory</hi> of an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nluky Citizen;</hi> ſo that I find I have had many Fellows, eſpecially about the time that my chief <hi>unlukyneſs</hi> began: the fire time how many were then rich one day and poor the next; but above all the misfortunes that hapned in that dreadful cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, none in my opinion equalled that of one of my Acquaintance, a Merchant an honeſt worthy brave man, but at that time mighty <hi>unlucky:</hi> he had by tradeing many years, at laſt gathered a plentifull
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:107141:168"/>
Eſtate 10000 l. of which he had laid out in a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe in the Country, and above 20000 l. more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in Pearls and Diamonds and other Jewels, this being in an Iron Cheſt, were depoſited and left at an Apothecarryes Houſe in <hi>Fan church ſtreet:</hi> at the time of the Fire, the Merchant was gone to viſit his purchaſe in the Country; there was little danger that this ſhould be loſt, for the Fire came not to this houſe in three dayes after it began: the Cheſt was portable enough: and eaſily to be removed, ſeveral Friends of the abſent Merchants knowing where this Treaſure was, offered the Apothecarry to ſecure it: but he not at leaſt ſuſpecting the fire to damage his houſe, locked up his doors, and walked out into the fiields, as I have been told, to pray to God to ceaſe the Fire, and ſpare his Neighbours houſes: but at his return, he had no houſe of his own to go to, that and all his houſe hold goods, for he had removed none, was conſumed to aſhes, and that which was above all in value was this <hi>unlucky</hi> Cheſt of Jewels: here was a loſs that exceeded all I ever have read of, in ſo little room the valew of a whole ſtreet of Houſes was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in a moment; they were all ſpoyled; the cheſt upon ſearch was found, and ſo where the Jewels, but the Diamonds not of ſo much uſe as <hi>Briſtow</hi>-ſtones, and a parcel of Whiteings eyes were of more luſtre and worth then any of the Pearls that was then found. I ſhall inſiſt upon but one ſtory more, and that a <hi>lucky</hi> one, and conclude. This is of the famous <hi>Sir R. Wittington,</hi> coming to <hi>London</hi> in Leathern Breeches to ſeek his fortune here, found a good one: being firſt entertained as a ſcullion into a Merchants houſe, his Maſter being a great Trader, was uſed to cauſe all his Servants, to ſend ſome adventures to Sea, when he did, <hi>Whittington</hi> had nothing which he could call
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107141:169"/>
his own, but a Cat, which he delivers to the Maſter of the Ship, who hapning into a ſtrange Country where they were much troubled with Rats and Mice, could find no wayes to deſtroy them, this Cat prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only remedy againſt them, turned to ſo good an account, that in exchange, ſuch ſtore of Gold and Treaſure was given for her, as raiſed this <hi>Favourite of Fate,</hi> to be <hi>Lord Mayor of London,</hi> as is expreſſed in the Title Page or Front of the Book; where alſo is deſcribed: ſomewhat of my own late <hi>unluckyneſs,</hi> that being bound for another man, entring into the <hi>Bond of ſurety ſhip,</hi> I am as yet ſqueezed, and know not how to get out, ſuch is ſtill my <hi>unluckynes,</hi> that when I think my ſelf freeſt and leaſt concerned, ſome misfortune befalls me: for when I writ the Preface of this Book, which was about ſix moneths ſince, I reckoned my ſelf to be in a thriveing condition, and ſo I thank God, I have been ſince, and had by my care, induſtry and Gods bleſſing, imbettered my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate at leaſt threſcore pounds: but before this Book is publiſhed, even between the <hi>cup and the lip,</hi> falls out a misfortune by the death of my Printer, as you may read in my Epiſtle, whereby I am 300 l. worſe then I was. By this I have again tryed the uncertainty of Fortune, what and how ſhe hath dealt with me for the firſt twenty years of my Life: I have in this Treatiſe particularly acquainted thee, how ſhe hath been at the ſame unconſtancy or worſe; for the laſt twenty one years, thou muſt already conclude by what I have written in my Preface and Epiſtle. It will be my work (if thou likeſt of this) to give thee the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of that, whereby I think thou mayeſt conclude with me that hitherto I have been <hi>An <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlucky Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen.</hi>
